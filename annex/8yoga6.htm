<H1>YOGA FOR YELLOWBELLIES<br>
Second Lecture</H1>

Mr. Chairman, Your Royal Highness, Your Grace, my lords, ladies
and gentlemen.
<P>
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.
<P>
In my last lecture I led you into the quag of delusion; I smothered
you in the mire of delusion; I brought you to thirst in the desert
of delusion; I left you wandering in the jungle of delusion, a
prey to all the monsters which are thoughts.  It came into my
mind that it was up to me to do something about it.
<P>
We have constantly been discussing mysterious entities as if we
knew something about them, and this (on examination) always turned
out not to be the case.

<p>2. Knowledge itself is impossible, because if we take the
simplest proposition of knowledge, S is P, we must attach some
meaning to S and P, if our statement is to be intelligible.  (I
say nothing as to whether it is true!)  And this involves definition.
Now the original proposition of identity, A = A, tells us nothing
at all, unless the second A gives us further information about
the first A.  We shall therefore say that A is BC.  Instead of
one unknown we have two unknowns; we have to define B as DE, C
as FG.  Now we have four unknowns, and very soon we have used
up the alphabet.  When we come to define Z, we have to go back
and use one of the other letters, so that all our arguments are
arguments in a circle.
<p>3. Any statement which we make is demonstrably meaningless.
<P>
And yet we do mean something when we say that a cat has four legs.
And we all know what we mean when we say so.  We give our assent
to, or withhold it from, the proposition on the grounds of our
experience.  But that experience is not intellectual, as above
demonstrated.  It is a matter of immediate intuition.  We cannot
have any warrant for that intuition, but at the same time any
intellectual argument which upsets it does not in the faintest
degree shake our conviction.

<p>4. The conclusion to be drawn from this is that the instrument
of mind is not intellectual, not rational.  Logic is merely destructive,
a self-destructive toy.  The toy, however, is in some ways also
instructive, even though the results of its use will not bear
examination.  So we make a by-law that the particular sorites
which annihilate logic are out of bounds, and we go on reasoning
within arbitrarily appointed limits.  It is subject to these conditions
that we may proceed to examine the nature of our fundamental ideas;
and this is necessary, because since we began to consider the
nature of the results of meditation, our conceptions of the backgrounds
of thought are decided in quite a different manner; not by intellectual
analysis, which, as we have seen, carries no conviction, but by
illumination, which does carry conviction.  Let us, therefore,
proceed to examine the elements of our normal thinking.
<p>5. I need hardly recapitulate the mathematical theorem which
you all doubtless laid to heart when you were criticising Einstein's
theory of relatively.  I only want to recall to your minds the
simplest element of that theorem; the fact that in order to describe
anything at all, you must have four measurements.  It must be
so far east or west, so far north or south, so far up or down,
from a standard point, and it must be after or before a standard
moment.  There are three dimensions of space and one of time.
<p>6. Now what do we mean by space?  Henri Poincare, one of the
greatest mathematicians of the last generation, thought that the
idea of space was invented by a lunatic, in a fantastic (and evidently
senseless and aimless) endeavour to explain to himself his experience
of his muscular movements.  Long before that, Kant had told us
that space was subjective, a necessary condition of thinking;
and while every one must agree with this, it is obvious that it
does not tell us much about it.
<p>7. Now let us look into our minds and see what idea, if any,
we can form about space.  Space is evidently a continuum.  There
cannot be any difference between any parts of it because it is
wholly <em>where</em>.  It is pure background, the area of possibilities,
a condition of quality and so of all consciousness.  It is therefore
in itself completely void.  Is that right, sir?
<p>8. Now suppose we want to fulfil one of these possibilities.
<P>
The simplest thing we can take is a point, and we are told that
a point has neither parts nor magnitude, but only position.  But,
as long as there is only one point, position means nothing.  No
possibility has yet been created of any positive statement. 
We will therefore take two points, and from these we get the idea
of a line.  Our Euclid tells us that a line has length but no
breadth.  But, as long as there are only two points, length itself
means nothing; or, at the most, it means separateness.  All we
can say about two points is that there are two of them.

<p>9. Now we take a third point, and at last we come to a more
positive idea.  In the first place, we have a plane surface, though
that in itself still means nothing, in the same way as length
means nothing when there are only two points there.  But the introduction
of the third point has given a meaning to our idea of length.
We can say that the line AB is longer than the line BC, and we
can also introduce the idea of an angle.
<p>10. A fourth point, provided that it is not in the original
plane, gives us the idea of a solid body.  But, as before, it
tells us nothing about the solid body as such, because there is
no other solid body with which to compare it.  We find also that
it is not really a solid body at all as it stands, because it
is merely an instantaneous kind of illusion.  We cannot observe,
or even imagine, anything, unless we have time for the purpose.
<p>11. What, then is time?  It is a phantasm, exactly as tenuous
as space, but the possibilities of differentiation between one
thing and another can only occur in one way instead of in three
different ways.  We compare two phenomena in time by the idea
of sequence.
<p>12. Now it will be perfectly clear to all of you that this
is all nonsense.  In order to conceive the simplest possible object,
we have to keep on inventing ideas, which even in the proud moment
of invention are seen to be unreal.  How are we to get away from
the world of phantasmagoria to the common universe of sense? 
We shall require quite a lot more acts of imagination.  We have
got to endow our mathematical conceptions with three ideas which
Hindu philosophers call Sat, Chit and Ananda, which are usually
translated Being, Knowledge and Bliss.  This really means:  Sat,
the tendency to conceive of an object as real; Chit, the tendency
to pretend that it is an object of knowledge; and Ananda, the
tendency to imagine that we are affected by it.
<p>13. It is only after we have endowed the object with these
dozen imaginary properties, each of which, besides being a complete
illusion, is an absurd, irrational, and self-contradictory notion,
that we arrive at even the simplest object of experience.  And
this object must, of course, be constantly multiplied.  Otherwise
our experience would be confined to a single object incapable
of description.
<p>14. We have also got to attribute to ourselves a sort of divine
power over our nightmare creation, so that we can compare the
different objects of our experience in all sorts of different
manners.  Incidentally, this last operation of multiplying the
objects stands evidently invalid, because (after all) what we
began with was absolutely Nothingness.  Out of this we have somehow
managed to obtain, not merely one, but many; but, for all that,
our process has followed the necessary operation of our intellectual
machine.  Since that machine is the only machine that we possess,
our arguments must be valid in some sense or other conformable
with the nature of this machine.  What machine?  That is a perfectly
real object.  It contains innumerable parts, powers and faculties.
And they are as much a nightmare as the external universe which
it has created.  Gad, sir, Patanjali is right!
<p>15. Now how do we get over this difficulty of something coming
from Nothing?  Only by enquiring what we mean by Nothing.  We
shall find that this idea is totally inconceivable to the normal
mind.  For if Nothing is to be Nothing, it must be Nothing in
every possible way.  (Of course, each of these ways is itself
an imaginary something, and there are Aleph-Zero-a transfinite
number-of them.) If, for example, we say that Nothing is a square
triangle, we have had to invent a square triangle in order to
say it.  But take a more homely instance.  We know what we mean
by saying 'There are cats in the room.'  We know what we mean
when we say 'No cats are in the room.'  But if we say '<em>No</em> cats
are <em>not</em> in the room,' we evidently mean that <em>some</em> cats <em>are</em>
in the room.  This remark is not intended to be a reflection upon
this distinguished audience.
<p>16. So then, if Nothing is to be really the absolute Nothing,
we mean that Nothing does not enter into the category of existence.
To say that absolute Nothing exists is equivalent to saying that
everything exists which exists, and the great Hebrew sages of
old time noted this fact by giving it the title of the supreme
idea of reality (behind their tribal God, Jehovah, who, as we
have previously shown, is merely the Yoga of the 4 Elements, even
at his highest, -- the Demiourgos) Eheieh-Asher-Eheieh, -- I am
that I am.
<p>17. If there is any sense in any of this at all, we may expect
to find an almost identical system of thought all over the world.
There is nothing exclusively Hebrew about this theogony.  We
find, for example, in the teachings of Zoroaster and the neo-Platonists
very similar ideas.  We have a Pleroma, the void, a background
of all possibilities, and this is filled by a supreme Light-God,
from whom drive in turn the seven Archons, who correspond closely
to the seven planetary deities, Aratron, Bethor, Phaleg and the
rest.  These in their turn constitute a Demiurge in order to create
matter; and this Demiurge is Jehovah.  Not far different are the
ideas both of the classical Greeks and the neo-Platonists.  The
differences in the terminology, when examined, appear as not much
more than the differences of local convenience in thinking. 
But all these go back to the still older cosmogony of the ancient
Egyptians, where we have Nuit, Space, Hadit, the point of view;
these experience congress, and so produce Heru-Ra-Ha, who combines
the ideas of Ra-Hoor-Khuit and Hoor-paar-Kraat.  These are the
same twin Vau and He' final which we know.  Here is evidently
the origin of the system of the Tree of Life.
<p>18. We have arrived at this system by purely intellectual
examination, and it is open to criticism; but the point I wish
to bring to your notice tonight is that it corresponds closely
to one of the great states of mind which reflect the experience
of Samadhi.
<p>There is a vision of peculiar character which has been of
cardinal importance in my interior life, and to which constant
reference is made in my Magical Diaries.  So far as I know, there
is no extant description of this vision anywhere, and I was surprised
on looking through my records to find that I had given no clear
account of it myself.  The reason apparently is that it is so
necessary a part of myself that I unconsciously assume it to be
a matter of common knowledge, just as one assumes that everyone
knows that one possesses a pair of lungs, and therefore abstains
from mentioning the fact directly, although perhaps alluding to
the matter often enough.
<p>It appears very essential to describe this vision as well
as possible, considering the difficulty of langauge, and the fact
that the phenomena involved logical contradictions, the conditions
of consciousness being other than those obtaining normally.
<p>The vision developed gradually.  It was repeated on so many
occasions that I am unable to say at what period it may be called
complete.  The beginning, however, is clear enough in my memory.
<p>19. I was on a Great Magical Retirement in a cottage overlooking
Lake Pasquaney in New Hampshire.  I lost consciousness of everything
but an universal space in which were innumerable bright points,
and I realised that this was a physical representation of the
universe, in what I may call its essential structure.  I exclaimed:

<p>'Nothingness, with twinkles!'  I concentrated upon this vision,
with the result that the void space which had been the principal
element of it diminished in importance.  Space appeared to be
ablaze, yet the radiant points were not confused, and I thereupon
completed my sentence with the exclamation:  'But <em>what</em> Twinkles!'
<p>20. The next stage of this vision led to an identification
of the blazing points with the stars of the firmament, with ideas,
souls, etc.  I perceived also that each star was connected by
a ray of light with each other star.  In the world of ideas, each
thought possessed a necessary relation with each other thought;
each such relation is of course a thought in itself; each such
ray is itself a star.  It is here that logical difficulty first
presents itself.  The seer has a direct perception of infinite
series.  Logically, therefore, it would appear as if the entire
space must be filled up with a homogeneous blaze of light.  This
is not, however, the case.  The space is completely full, yet
the monads which fill it are perfectly distinct.  The ordinary
reader might well exclaim that such statements exhibit symptoms
of mental confusion.  The subject demands more than cursory examination.
I can do no more than refer the critic to Bertrand Russell's
'Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy', where the above position
is thoroughly justified, as also certain positions which follow.
<p>I want you to note in particular the astonishing final identification
of this cosmic experience with the nervous system as described
by the anatomist.
<p>21. At this point we may well be led to consider once more
what we call the objective universe, and what we call our subjective
experience.  What is Nature?  Immanuel Kant, who founded an epoch-making
system of subjective idealism, is perhaps the first philosopher
to demonstrate clearly that space, time, causality (in short,
all conditions of existence) are really no more than conditions
of thought.  I have tried to put it more simply by defining all
possible predicates as so many dimensions.  To describe an object
properly it is not sufficient to determine its position in the
space-time continuum of four dimensions, but we must enquire
how it stands in all the categories and scales, its values in
all 'kinds' of possibility.  What do we know about it in respect
of its greenness, its hardness, its mobility, and so on?  And
then we find out that what we imagine to be the description of
the object is in reality nothing of the sort.
<p>22. All that we recorded is the behaviour of our instruments.
<P>
What did our telescopes, spectroscopes, and balances tell us?
And these again are dependent upon the behaviour of our senses;
for the reality of our instruments, of our organs of sense, is
just as much in need of description and demonstration as are the
most remote phenomena.  And we find ourselves forced to the conclusion
that anything we perceive is only perceived by us as such 'because
of our tendency so to perceive it.'  And we shall find that in
the fourth stage of the great Buddhist practice, Mahasatipatthana,
we become directly and immediately aware of this fact instead
of digging it out of the holts of these interminable sorites which
badger us!  Kant himself put it, after his fashion:  'The laws
of nature are the laws of our own minds.'  Why?  It is not the
contents of the mind itself that we can cognise, but only its
structure.  But Kant has not gone to this length.  He would have
been extremely shocked if it had ever struck him that the final
term in his sorites was 'Reason itself is the only reality.' 
On further examination, even this ultimate truth turns out to
be meaningless.  It is like the well known circular definition
of an obscene book, which is:  one that arouses certain ideas
in the mind of the kind of person in whom such ideas are excited
by that kind of book.

<p>23. I notice that my excellent chairman is endeavouring to
stifle a yawn and to convert it into a smile, and he will forgive
me for saying that I find the effect somewhat sinister.  But he
has every right to be supercilious about it.  These are indeed
'old, fond paradoxes to amuse wives in ale-houses.'  Since philosophy
began, it has always been a favourite game to prove your axioms
absurd.
<p>You will all naturally be very annoyed with me for indulging
in these fatuous pastimes, especially as I started out with a
pledge that I would deal with these subjcts from the hard-headed
scientific point of view.  Forgive me if I have toyed with these
shining gossamers of the thought-web!  I have only been trying
to break it to you gently.  I proceed to brush away with a sweep
of my lily-white hand all this tenuous, filmy stuff, 'such stuff
as dreams are made of.'  We will get down to modern science.
<p>24. For general reading there is no better introduction than
'The Bases of Modern Science', by my old and valued friend the
late J. W. N. Sullivan.  I do not want to detain you too long
with quotations from this admirable book.  I would much rather
you got it and read it yourself; you could hardly make better
use of your time.  But let us spend a few moments on his remarks
about the question of geometry.
<P>
Our conceptions of space as a subjective entity has been completely
upset by the discovery that the equations of Newton based on Euclidean
Geometry are inadequate to explain the phenomena of gravitation.
It is instinctive to us to think of a straight line; it is somehow
axiomatic.  But we learn that this does not exist in the objective
universe.  We have to use another geometry, Riemann's Geometry,
which is one of the curved geometries.  (There are, of course,
as many systems of geometry as there are absurd axioms to build
them on.  Three lines make one ellipse:  any nonsense you like:
you can proceed to construct a geometry which is correct so long
as it is coherent.  And there is nothing right or wrong about
the result:  the only question is:  which is the most convenient
system for the purpose of describing phenomena?  We found the
idea of Gravitation awkward:  we went to Riemann.)
<P>
This means that the phenomena are not taking place against a background
of a flat surface; the surface itself is curved.  What we have
thought of as a straight line does not exist at all.  And this
is almost impossible to conceive; at least it is quite impossible
for myself to visualise.  The nearest one gets to it is by trying
to imagine that you are a reflection on a polished door-knob.

<p>25. I feel almost ashamed of the world that I have to tell
you that in the year 1900, four years before the appearance of
Einstein's world-shaking paper, I described space as 'finite yet
boundless,' which is exactly the description in general terms
that he gave in more mathematical detail.<a href="8yoga6.htm#*">(*)</a>  You will see at
once that these three words do describe a curved geometry; a sphere,
for instance, is a finite object, yet you can go over the surface
in any direction without ever coming to an end.
<p>I said above that Riemann's Geometry was not quite sufficient
to explain the phenomena of nature.  We have to postulate different
kinds of curvature in different parts of the continuum.  And even
then we are not happy!
<p>26. Now for a spot of Sullivan!  'The geometry is so general
that it admits of different degrees of curvature in different
parts of space-time.  It is to this curvature that gravitational
effects are due.  The curvature of space-time is most prominent,
therefore, around large masses, for here the gravitational effects
are most marked.  If we take matter as fundamental, we may say
that it is the presence of matter that causes the curvature of
space-time.  But there is a different school of thought that regards
matter as due to the curvature of space-time.  That is, we assume
as fundamental a space-time continuum manifest to our senses as
what we call matter.  Both points of view have strong arguments
to recommend them.  But, whether or not matter may be derived
from the geometrical peculiarities of the space-time continuum,
we may take it as an established scientific fact that gravitation
has been so derived.  This is obviously a very great achievement,
but it leaves quite untouched another great class of phenomena,
namely, electro-magnetic phenomena.  In this space-time continuum
of Einstein's the electro-magnetic forces appear as entirely alien.
Gravitation has been absorbed, as it were, into Riemannian geometry,
and the notion of force, so far as gravitational phenomena are
concerned, has been abolished.  But the electro-magnetic forces
still flourish undisturbed.  There is no hint that they are manifestations
of the geometrical peculiarities of the space-time continuum.
And it can be shown to be impossible to relate them to anything
in Riemann's Geometry.  Gravitation can be shown to correspond
to certain geometrical peculiarities of a Riemannian space-time.
But the electro-magnetic forces lie completely outside this scheme.'
<p>
27. Here is the great quag into which mathematical physics
has led its addicts.  Here we have two classes of phenomena, all
part of a unity of physics.  Yet the equations which describe
and explain the one class are incompatible with those of the other
class!  This is not a question of philosophy at all, but a question
of fact.  It does not do to consider that the universe is composed
of particles.  Such a hypothesis underlies one class of phenomena,
but it is nonsense when applied to the electro-magnetic equations,
which insist upon our abandoning the idea of particles for that
of waves.
<p>Here is another Welsh rabbit for supper!
<p>'Einstein's finite universe is such that its radius is dependent
upon the amount of matter in it.  Were more matter to be created,
the volume of the universe would increase.  Were matter to be
annihilated, the volume of space would decrease.  Without matter,
space would not exist.  Thus the mere existence of space, besides
its metrical properties, depends upon the existence of matter.
With this conception it becomes possible to regard all motion,
including rotation, as purely relative.'
<p>Where do we go from here, boys?

<p>28. 'The present tendency of physics is towards describing
the universe in terms of mathematical relations between unimaginable
entities.'
<p>We have got a long way from Lord Kelvin's too-often and too-unfairly
quoted statement that he could not imagine anything of which he
could not construct a mechanical model.  The Victorians were really
a little inclined to echo Dr. Johnson's gross imbecile stamp on
the ground when the ideas of Bishop Berkeley penetrated to the
superficial strata of the drink-sodden grey cells of that beef-witted
brute.
<p>29. Now, look you, I ask you to reflect upon the trouble we
have taken to calculate the distance of the fixed stars, and hear
Professor G. N. Lewis, who 'suggests that two atoms connected
by a light ray may be regarded as in actual physical contact.
The <em>interval</em> between two ends of a light-ray is, on the theory
of relativity, zero, and Professor Lewis suggests that this fact
should be taken seriously.  On this theory, light is not propagated
at all.  This idea is in conformity with the principle that none
but observable factors should be used in constructing a scientific
theory, for we can certainly never observe the passage of light
in empty space.  We are only aware of light when it encouters
matter.  Light which never encounters matter is purely hypothetical.
If we do not make that hypothesis, then there is no empty space.
On Professor Lewis's theory, when we observe a distant star,
our eye as truly makes physical contact with that star as our
finger makes contact with a table when we press it.'
<p>30. And did not all of you think that my arguments were arguments
in a circle?  I certainly hope you did, for I was at the greatest
pains to tell you so.  But it is not a question of argument in
Mr. Sullivan's book; it is a question of facts.  He was talking
about human values.  He was asking whether science could possibly
be cognizant of them.  Here he comes, the great commander!  Cheer,
my comrades, cheer!
<p>'But although consistent materialists were probably always
rare, the humanistically important fact remained that science
did not find it necessary to include values in its description
of the universe.  For it appeared that science, in spite of this
omission, formed a closed system.  If values form an integral
part of reality, it seems strange that science should be able
to give a consistent description of phenomena which ignores them.
<P>
'At the present time, this difficulty is being met in two ways.
<P>
On the one hand, it is pointed out that science remains within
its own domain by the device of cyclic definition, that is to
say, the abstractions with which it begins are all it ever talks
about.  It makes no fresh contacts with reality, and therefore
never encounters any possibly disturbing factors.  This point
of view is derived from the theory of relativity, particularly
from the form of presentation adopted by Eddington.  This theory
forms a closed circle.  The primary terms of the theory, <em>point-events</em>,
<em>potentials</em>, <em>matter</em> (etc.-there are ten of them), lie at various
points on the circumference of the circle.  We may start at any
point and go round the circle, that is, from any one of these
terms we can deduce the others.  The primary entities of the theory
are defined in terms of one another.  In the course of this exercise
we derive the laws of Nature studied in physics.  At a certain
point in the chain of deductions, at <em>matter</em>, for example, we
judge that we are talking about something which is an objective
concrete embodiment of our abstractions.  But matter, as it occurs
in physics, is no more than a particular set of abstractions,
and our subsequent reasoning is concerned only with these abstractions.
Such other characteristics as the objective reality may possess
never enter our scheme.  But the set of abstractions called matter
in relativity theory do not seem to be adequate to the whole of
our scientific knowledge of matter.  There remain quantum phenomena.'
<p><big>Ah!</big>
<P align=right>
'So we leave her, so we leave her,<br>
Far from where her swarthy kindred roam-kindred roam<br>
In the Scarlet Fever, Scarlet Fever,<br>
Scarlet Fever Convalescent Home.'

<p>31. So now, no less than that chivalrous gentleman, His Grace,
the Most Reverend the Archbishop of Canterbury, who in a recent
broadcast confounded for ever all those infidels who had presumed
to doubt the possibility of devils entering into swine, we have
met the dragon science and conquered.  We have seen that, however
we attack the problem of mind, whether from the customary spiritual
standpoint, or from the opposite corner of materialism, the result
is just the same.
<p>One last quotation from Mr. Sullivan.  'The universe may ultimately
prove to be irrational.  The scientific adventure may have to
be given up.'
<p>But that is all <em>he</em> knows about science, bless his little
heart!  We do not give up.  'You lied, d'Ormea, I do not repent!'
The results of experiment are still valid for experience, and
the fact that the universe turns out on enquiry to be unintelligible
only serves to fortify our ingrained conviction that experience
itself is reality.
<p>32. We may then ask ourselves whether it is not possible to
obtain experience of a higher order, to discover and develop the
faculty of mind which can transcend analysis, stable against all
thought by virtue of its own self-evident assurance.  In the language
of the Great White Brotherhood (whom I am here to represent) you
cross the abyss.  'Leave the poor old stranded wreck'-Ruach- 'and
pull for the shore' of Neschamah.  For above the abyss, it is
said, as you will see if you study the Supplement of the fifth
number of the First Volume of 'The Equinox', an idea is only true
in so far as it contains its contradictory in itself.
<p>33. It is such states of mind as this which constitute the
really important results of Samyama, and these results are not
to be destroyed by philosophical speculation, because they are
not susceptible of analysis, because they have no component parts,
because they exist by virtue of their very Unreason-'certum est
quia ineptum!' They cannot be expressed, for they are above knowledge.
To some extent we can convey our experience to others familiar
with that experience to a less degree by the aesthetic method.
And this explains why all the good work on Yoga-alchemy, magick
and the rest-not doctrinal but symbolic-the word of God to man,
is given in Poetry and Art.
<P>
In my next lecture I shall endeavour to go a little deeper into
the technique of obtaining these results, and also give a more
detailed account of the sort of thing that is likely to occur
in the course of the preliminary practices.
<P>
Love is the law, love under will.
