<H1>YOGA FOR YAHOOS<br>
Third Lecture - Niyama</H1>

Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.

<p>1. The subject of my third lecture is Niyama.  Niyama?  H'm!
<P>
The inadequacy of even the noblest attempts to translate these
wretched Sanskrit words is now about to be delightfully demonstrated.
 The nearest I can get to the meaning of Niyama is 'virtue'! 
God help us all!  This means virtue in the original etymological
sense of the word-the quality of manhood; that is, to all intents
and purposes, the quality of godhead.  But since we are translating
Yama 'control,' we find that our two words have not at all the
same relationship to each other that the words have in the original
Sanskrit; for the prefix 'ni' in Sanskrit gives the meaning of
turning everything upside down and backwards forwards, -- as <em>you</em>
would say, Hysteron Proteron-at the same time producing the effect
of transcendental sublimity.  I find that I cannot even begin
to think of a proper definition, although I know in my own mind
perfectly well what the Hindus mean; if one soaks oneself in Oriental
thought for a sufficient number of years, one gets a spiritual
apprehension which it is quite impossible to express in terms
applicable to the objects of intellectual apprehension; it is
therefore much better to content ourselves with the words as they
stand, and get down to brass tacks about the practical steps to
be taken to master these preliminary exercises.
<p>
2. It will hardly have escaped the attentive listener that
in my previous lectures I have combined the maximum of discourse
with the minimum of information; that is all part of my training
as a Cabinet Minister.  But what does emerge tentatively from
my mental fog is that Yama, taking it by long and by large, is
mostly negative in its effects.  We are imposing inhibitions on
the existing current of energy, just as one compresess a waterfall
in turbines in order to control and direct the natural gravitational
energy of the stream.
<p>
3. It might be as well, before altogether leaving the subject
of Yama, to enumerate a few of the practical conclusions which
follow from our premise that nothing which might weaken or destroy
the beauty and harmony of the mind must be permitted.  Social
existence of any kind renders any serious Yoga absolutely out
of the question; domestic life is completely incompatible with
even elementary practices.  No doubt many of you will say, 'That's
all very well for him; let him speak for himself; as for me, I
manage my home and my business so that everything runs on ball
bearings.'  Echo answers . . .
<p>
4. Until you actually start the practice of Yoga, you cannot
possibly imagine what constitutes a disturbance.  You, most of
you, think that you can sit perfectly still; you tell me what artists'
models can do for over thirty-five minutes.  They don't.  You
do not hear the ticking of the clock; perhaps you do not even
know whether a typewriter is going in the room; for all I know,
you could sleep peacefully through an air-raid.  That has nothing
to do with it.  As soon as you start the practices you will find,
if you are doing them properly, that you are hearing sounds which
you never heard before in your life.  You become hypersensitive.
And as you have five external batteries bombarding you, you get
little repose.  You feel the air on your skin with about the same
intensity as you would previously have felt a fist in your face.
<p>
5. To some extent, no doubt, this fact will be familiar to
all of you.  Probably most of you have been out at some time or
other in what is grotesquely known as the silence of the night,
and you will have become aware of infinitesimal movements of light
in the darkness, of elusive sounds in the quiet.  They will have
soothed you and pleased you; it will never have occurred to you
that these changes could each one be felt as a pang.  But, even
in the earliest months of Yoga, this is exactly what happens,
and therefore it is best to be prepared by arranging, before you
start at all, that your whole life will be permanently free from
all the grosser causes of trouble.  The practical problem of Yama
is therefore, to a great extent, 'How shall I settle down to the
work?'  Then, having complied with the theoretically best conditions,
you have to tackle each fresh problem as it arises in the best
way you can.
<p>
6. We are now in a better position to consider the meaning
of Niyama, or virtue.  To most men the qualities which constitute
Niyama are not apprehended at all by their self-consciousness.
These are positive powers, but they are latent; their development
is not merely measurable in terms of quantity and efficiency.
As we rise from the coarse to the fine, from the gross to the
subtle, we enter a new (and what appears on first sight to be
an immeasurable) region.  It is quite impossible to explain what
I mean by this; if I could, you would know it already.  How can
one explain to a person who has never skated the nature of the
pleasure of executing a difficult figure on the ice?  He has in
himself the whole apparatus ready for use; but experience, and
experience only, can make him aware of the results of such use.
<p>
7. At the same time, in a general exposition of Yoga, it may
be useful to give some idea of the functions on which those peaks
that pierce the clouds of the limitations of our intellectual
understanding are based.
<p>
I have found it very useful in all kinds of thinking to employ
a sort of Abacus.  The schematic representation of the universe
given by astrology and the Tree of Life is extremely valuable,
especially when reinforced and amplified by the Holy Qabalah.
This Tree of Life is susceptible to infinite ramifications, and
there is no need in this connection to explore its subtleties.
We ought to be able to make a fairly satisfactory diagram for
elementary purposes by taking as the basis of our illustration
the solar system as conceived by the astrologers.
<p>
I do not know whether the average student is aware that in
practice the significations of the planets are based generally
upon the philosophical conceptions of the Greek and Roman gods.
Let us hope for the best, and go on!
<p>
8. The planet Saturn, which represents anatomy, is the skeleton:
it is a rigid structure upon which the rest of the body is built.
To what moral qualities does this correspond?  The first point
of virtue in a bone is its rigidity, its resistance to pressure.
And so in Niyama we find that we need the qualities of absolute
simplicity in our regimen; we need insensibility; we need endurance;
we need patience.  It is simply impossible for anyone who has
not practised Yoga to understand what boredom means.  I have known
Yogis, men even holier than I, (*no! no!*) who, to escape from
the intolerable tedium, would fly for refuge to a bottle party!
It is a 'physiological' tedium which becomes the acutest agony.
The tension becomes cramp; nothing else matters but to escape
from the self-imposed constraint.
<p>
But every evil brings its own remedy.  Another quality of
Saturn is melancholy; Saturn represents the sorrow of the universe;
it is the Trance of sorrow that has determined one to undertake
the task of emancipation.  This is the energising force of Law;
it is the rigidity of the fact that everything is sorrow which
moves one to the task, and keeps one on the Path.
<p>
9. The next planet is Jupiter.  This planet is in many ways
the opposite of Saturn; it represents expansion as Saturn represents
contraction; it is the universal love, the selfless love whose
object can be no less than the universe itself.  This comes to
reinforce the powers of Saturn when they agonise; success is not
for self but for all; one might acquiesce in one's own failure,
but one cannot be unworthy of the universe.  Jupiter, too, represents
the vital, creative, genial element of the cosmos.  He has Ganymede
and Hebe to his cupbearers.  There is an immense and inaccessible
joy in the Great Work; and it is the attainment of the trance,
of even the intellectual foreshadowing of that trance, of joy,
which reassures the Yogi that his work is worth while.
<p>
Jupiter digests experiences; Jupiter is the Lord of the Forces
of Life; Jupiter takes common matter and transmutes it into celestial
nourishment.
<p>
10. The next planet is Mars.  Mars represents the muscular
system; it is the lowest form of energy, and in Niyama it is to
be taken quite literally as the virtue which enables one to contend
with, and to conquer, the physical difficulties of the Work. 
The practical point is this:  'The little more and how much it
is, the little less and what worlds away!'  No matter how long
you keep water at 99 degrees Centigrade under normal barometric
pressure, it will not boil.  I shall probably be accused of advertising
some kind of motor spirit in talking about the little extra something
that the others haven't got, but I assure you that I am not being
paid for it.
<p>
Let us take the example of Pranayama, a subject with which
I hope to deal in a subsequent lucubration.  Let us suppose that
you are managing your breath so that your cycle, breathing in,
holding, and breathing out, lasts exactly a minute.  That is pretty
good work for most people, but it may be or may not be good enough
to get you going.  No one can tell you until you have tried long
enough (and no one can tell you how long 'long enough' may be)
whether that is going to ring the bell.  It may be that if you
increase your sixty seconds to sixty-four the phenomena would
begin immediately.  That sounds all right but as you have nearly
burst your lungs doing the sixty, you want this <em>added</em> energy
to make the grade.  That is only one example of the difficulty
which arises with every practice.
<p>
Mars, morever, is the flaming energy of passion, it is the
male quality in its lowest sense; it is the courage which goes
berserk, and I do not mind telling you that, in my own case at
least, one of the inhibitions with which I had most frequently
to contend was the fear that I was going mad.  This was especially
the case when those phenomena began to occur, which, recorded
in cold blood, did seem like madness.  And the Niyama of Mars
is the ruthless rage which jests at scars while dying of one's
wounds.
<blockquote>' . . . the grim Lord of Colonsay<br>
Hath turned him on the ground,<br>
And laughed in death-pang that his blade<br>
The mortal thrust so well repaid'
</blockquote>
<p>
11. The next of the heavenly bodies is the centre of all,
the Sun.  The Sun is the heart of the system; he harmonises all, energises
all, orders all.  His is the courage and energy which is the source
of all the other lesser forms of motion, and it is because of
this that in himself he is calm.  They are planets; he is a star.
For him all planets come; around him they all move, to him they
all tend.  It is this centralisation of faculties, their control,
their motivation, which is the Niyama of the Sun.  He is not only
the heart but the brain of the system; but he is not the 'thinking'
brain, for in him all thought has been resolved into the beauty
and harmony of ordered motion.
<p>
12. The next of the planets is Venus.  In her, for the first
time, we come into contact with a part of our nature which is
none the less quintessential because it has hitherto been masked
by our preoccupation with more active qualities.  Venus resembles
Jupiter, but on a lower scale, standing to him very much as Mars
does to Saturn.  She is close akin in nature to the Sun, and she
may be considered an externalisation of his influence towards
beauty and harmony.  Venus is Isis, the Great Mother; Venus is
Nature herself;
<p>Venus is the sum of all possibilities.
<p>
The Niyama corresponding to Venus is one of the most important,
and one of the most difficult of attainment.  I said the sum of
all possibilities, and I will ask you to go back in your minds
to what I said before about the definition of the Great Work itself,
the aim of the Yogi to consummate the marriage of all that he
is with all that he is not, and ultimately to realise, insofar
as the marriage is consummated, that what he is and what he is
not are identical.  Therefore we cannot pick and choose in our
Yoga.  It is written in the 'Book of the Law', Chapter 1, verse
22, 'Let there be no difference made among you between any one
thing and any other thing, for thereby there cometh hurt.'
<p>Venus represents the ecstatic acceptance of all possible experience,
and the transcendental assumption of all particular experience
into the one experience.
<p>Oh yes, by the way, don't forget this.  In a lesser sense
Venus represents tact.  Many of the problems that confront the
Yogi are impracticable to intellectual manipulation.  They yield
to graciousness. 
<p>13. Our next planet is Mercury, and the Niyama which correspond
to him are as innumerable and various as his own qualities.  Mercury
is the Word, the Logos in the highest; he is the direct medium
of connection between opposites; he is electricity, the very link
of life, the Yogic process itself, its means, its end.  Yet he
is in himself indifferent to all things, as the electric current
is indifferent to the meaning of the messages which may be transmitted
by its means.  The Niyama corresponding to Mercury in its highest
forms may readily be divined from what I have already said, but
in the technique of Yoga he represents the fineness of the method
which is infinitely adaptable to all problems, and only so because
he is supremely indifferent.  He is the adroitness and ingenuity
which helps us in our difficulties; he is the mechanical system,
the symbolism which helps the human mind of the Yogi to take cognisance
of what is coming.
<p>It must here be remarked that because of his complete indifference
to anything whatever (and that thought is-when you get far enough-only
a primary point of wisdom) he is entirely unreliable.  One of
the most unfathomably dreadful dangers of the Path is that you
must trust Mercury, and yet that if you trust him you are certain
to be deceived.  I can only explain this, if at all, by pointing
out that, since all truth is relative, all truth is falsehood.
In one sense Mercury is the great enemy; Mercury is mind, and
it is the mind that we have set out to conquer.
<p>14. The last of the seven sacred planets is the Moon.  The
Moon represents the totality of the female part of us, the passive
principle which is yet very different to that of Venus, for the
Moon corresponds to the Sun much as Venus does to Mars.  She is
more purely passive than Venus, and although Venus is so universal
the Moon is also universal in another sense.  The Moon is the
highest and the lowest; the Moon is the aspiration, the link of
man and God; she is the supreme purity:  Isis the Virgin, Isis
the Virgin Mother; but she comes right down at the other end of
the scale, to be a symbol of the senses themselves, the mere instrument
of the registration of phenomena, incapable of discrimination,
incapable of choice.  The Niyama corresponding to her influence,
the first of all, is that quality of aspiration, the positive
purity which refuses union with anything less than the All.  In
Greek mythology Artemis, the Goddess of the Moon, is virgin; she
yielded only to Pan.  Here is one particular lesson:  as the
Yogi advances, magic powers (Siddhi the teachers call them) are
offered to the aspirant; if he accepts the least of these-or the
greatest-he is lost.
<p>15. At the other end of the scale of the Niyama of the Moon
are the fantastic developments of sensibility which harass the
Yogi.  These are all help and encouragement; these are all intolerable
hindrances; these are the greatest of the obstacles which confront
the human being, trained as he is by centuries of evolution to
receive his whole consciousness through the senses alone.  And
they hit us hardest because they interfere directly with the technique
of our work; we are constantly gaining new powers, despite ourselves,
and every time this happens we have to invent a new method for
bringing their malice to naught.  But, as before, the remedy is
of the same stuff as the disease; it is the unswerving purity
of aspiration that enables us to surmount all these difficulties.
The Moon is the sheet-anchor of our work.  It is the Knowledge
and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel that enables us to
overcome, at all times and in all manners, as the need of the
moment may be.
<p>16. There are two other planets, not counted as among the
sacred seven.  I will not say that they were known to the ancients
and deliberately concealed, though much in their writing suggests
that this may be the case.  I refer to the planet Herschel, or
Uranus, and Neptune.  Whatever may have been the knowledge of
the ancients, it is at least certain that they left gaps in their
system which were exactly filled by these two planets, and the
newly discovered Pluto.  They fill these gaps just as the newly
discovered chemical elements discovered in the last fifty years
fill the gaps in Mendelejeff's table of the Periodic Law.
<p>17. Herschel represents the highest form of the True Will,
and it seems natural and right that this should not rank with
the seven sacred planets, because the True Will is the sphere
which transcends them.  'Every man and every woman is a star.'
Herschel defines the orbit of the star, your star.  But Herschel
is dynamic; Herschel is explosive; Herschel, astrologically speaking,
does not move in an orbit; he has his own path.  So the Niyama
which corresponds to this planet is, first and last, the discovery
of the True Will.  This knowledge is secret and most sacred; each
of you must incorporate for yourself the incidence and quality
of Herschel.  It is the most important of the tasks of the Yogi,
because, until he has achieved it, he can have no idea who he
is or where he is going.
<p>18. Still more remote and tenuous is the influence of Neptune.
<P>
Here we have a Niyama of infinite delicacy, a spiritual intuition
far, far removed from any human quality whatever.  Here all is
fantasy, and in this world are infinite pleasure, infinite perils.
The True Niyama of Neptune is the imaginative faculty, the shadowing
forth of the nature of the illimitable light.
<P>
He has another function.  The Yogi who understands the influence
of Neptune, and is attuned to Neptune, will have a sense of humour,
which is the greatest safeguard for the Yogi.  Neptune is, so
to speak, in the front line; he has got to adapt himself to difficulties
and tribulations; and when the recruit asks 'What made that 'ole?'
he has got to say, unsmiling, 'Mice.'
<P>
Pluto is the utmost sentinel of all; of him it is not wise to
speak.
<P>
. . . Having now given vent to this sybilline, obscure and sinister
utterance, it may well be asked by the greatly daring:  Why is
it not wise to speak of Pluto?  The answer is profound.  It is
because nothing at all is known about him.
<P>
Anyhow it hardly matters; we have surely had enough of Niyama
for one evening!

<p>19. It is now proper to sum up briefly what we have learnt
about Yama and Niyama.  They are in a sense the moral, logical
preliminaries of the technique of Yoga proper.  They are the strategical
as opposed to the tactical dispositions which must be made by
the aspirant before he attempts anything more serious than the
five finger exercises, as we may call them-the recruit's drill
of postures, breathing exercises and concentration which the shallow
confidently suppose to constitute this great science and art.
<p>We have seen that it is presumptuous and impractical to lay
down definite rules as to what we are to do.  What does concern
us is so to arrange matters that we are free to do anything that
may become necessary or expedient, allowing for that development
of supernormal powers which enables us to carry out our plans
as they form in the mutable bioscope of events.
<p>If anyone comes to me for a rough and ready practical plan
I say:  Well, if you must stay in England, you may be able to
bring it off with a bit of luck in an isolated cottage, remote
from roads, if you have the services of an attendant already well
trained to deal with the emergencies that are likely to arise.
A good disciplinarian might carry on fairly well, at a pinch,
in a suite in Claridge's.
<p>But against this it may be urged that one has to reckon with
unseen forces.  The most impossible things begin to happen when
once you get going.  It is not really satisfactory to start serious
Yoga unless you are in a country where the climate is reliable,
and where the air is not polluted by the stench of civilisation.
It is extremely important, above all things important, unless
one is an exceedingly rich man, to find a country where the inhabitants
understand the Yogin mode of life, where they are sympathetic
with its practices, treat the aspirant with respect, and unobtrusively
assist and protect him.  In such circumstances, the exigency of
Yama and Niyama is not so serious a stress.
<p>There is, too, something beyond all these practical details
which it is hard to emphasise without making just those mysterious
assumptions which we have from the first resolved to avoid.  All
I can say is that I am very sorry, but this particular fact is
going to hit you in the face before you have started very long,
and I do not see why we should bother about the mysterious assumptions
underlying the acceptance of the fact any more than in the case
of what is after all equally mysterious and unfathomable:  any
object of any of the senses.  The fact is this; that one acquires
a feeling-a quite irrational feeling-that a given place or a given
method is right or wrong for its purposes.  The intimation is
as assured as that of the swordsman when he picks up an untried
weapon; either it comes up sweet to the hand, or it does not.
 You cannot explain it, and you cannot argue it away.
<p>21. I have treated Yama and Niyama at great length because
their importance has been greatly underrated, and their nature
completely misunderstood.  They are definitely magical practices,
with hardly a tinge of mystical flavour.  The advantage to us
here is that we can very usefully exercise and develop ourselves
in this way in this country where the technique of Yoga is for
all practical purposes impossible.  Incidentally, one's real country-that
is, the conditions in which one happens to be born is the only
one in which Yama and Niyama can be practised.  You cannot dodge
your Karma.  You have got to earn the right to devote yourself
to Yoga proper by arranging for that devotion to be a necessary
stage in the fulfilment of your True Will.  In Hindustan one is
not allowed to become 'Sanyasi'-a recluse-until one has fulfilled
one's duty to one's own environment-rendered to Caesar the things
which are Caesar's before rendering to God the things which are
God's.
<p>Woe to that seven months' abortion who thinks to take advantage
of the accidents of birth, and, mocking the call of duty, sneaks
off to stare at a blank wall in China!  Yama and Niyama are only
the more critical stages of Yoga because they cannot be translated
in terms of a schoolboy curriculum.  Nor can schoolboy tricks
adequately excuse the aspirant from the duties of manhood.  Do
what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.

<p><strong>Rejoice, true men, that this is thus!</strong>

<P>
For this at least may be said, that there are results to be obtained
in this way which will not only fit the aspirant for the actual
battle, but will introduce him to classes of hitherto unguessed
phenomena whose impact will prepare his mind for that terrific
shock of its own complete overthrow which marks the first critical
result of the practices of Yoga.
<P>
Love is the law, love under will.
