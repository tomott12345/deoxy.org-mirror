<H1>YOGA FOR YAHOOS<br>
Fourth Lecture - Asana and Pranayama</H1>
<P>
The Technical Practices of Yoga.
<P>
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.

<p>1. Last week we were able to go away feeling that the back
of the job had been broken.  We had got rid of bad ways, bad wives,
and bad weather.  We are comfortably installed in the sunshine,
with no one to bother us.  We have nothing to do but our work.
<p>Such being our fortunate state, we may usefully put in an
hour considering our next step.  Let us recall, in the first place,
what we decided to be the quintessence of our task.  It was to
annihilate dividuality.  'Make room for me,' cries the Persian
poet whose name I have forgotten, the fellow Fitzgerald translated,
not Omar Khayyam, 'Make room for me on that divan which has no
room for twain'-a remarkable prophetic anticipation of the luxury
flatlet.
<p>We are to unite the subject and object of consciousness in
the ecstasy which soon turns, as we shall find later on, into
the more sublime state of indifference, and then annihilate both
the party of the first part aforesaid and the party of the second
part aforesaid.  This evidently results in further parties-one
might almost say cocktail parties-constantly increasing until
we reach infinity, and annihilate that, thereby recovering our
original Nothing.  Yet is that identical with the original Nothing?
Yes-and No!  No!  No!  A thousand times no!  For, having fulfilled
all the possibilities of that original Nothing to manifest in
positive terms, we have thereby killed for ever all its possibilities
of mischief.
<p>Our task being thus perfectly simple, we shall not require
the assistance of a lot of lousy rishis and sanyasis.  We shall
not apply to a crowd of moth-eaten Arahats, of betel-chewing Bodhisattvas,
for instruction.  As we said in the first volume of 'The Equinox',
in the first number:
<blockquote>'We place no reliance<br>
On Virgin or Pigeon;<br>
Our method is science,<br>
Our aim is religion.'
</blockquote>

Our common sense, guided by experience based on observation, will
be sufficient.

<p>2. We have seen that the Yogic process is implicit in every
phenomenon of existence.  All that we have to do is to extend
it consciously to the process of thought.  We have seen that thought
cannot exist without continual change; all that we have to do
is to prevent change occurring.  All change is conditioned by
time and space and other categories; any existing object must
be susceptible of description by means of a system of coordinate
axes.
<p>On the 'terrasse' of the Cafe des Deux Magots it was once
necessary to proclaim the entire doctrine of Yoga in the fewest
possible words 'with a shout, and with the voice of the archangel,
and with the trump of God.'  St. Paul's First Epistle to the Thessalonians,
the Fourth Chapter and the Sixteenth Verse.  I did so.
<P>
'Sit still.  Stop thinking.  Shut up.  Get out!'
<P>
The first two of these instructions comprise the whole of the
technique of Yoga.  The last two are of a sublimity which it would
be improper to expound in this present elementary stage.
<P>
The injunction 'Sit still' is intended to include the inhibition
of all bodily stimuli capable of creating movement in consciousness.
The injunction 'Stop thinking' is the extension of this to all
mental stimuli.  It is unnecessary to discuss here whether the
latter can exist apart from the former.  It is at least evident
that many mental processes arise from physical processes; and
so we shall at least be getting a certain distance along the road
if we have checked the body.

<p>3. Let me digress for a moment, and brush away one misunderstanding
which is certain to occur to every Anglo-Saxon mind.  About the
worst inheritance of the emasculate school of mystics is the abominable
confusion of thought which arises from the idea that bodily functions
and appetites have some moral implications.  This is a confusion
of the planes.  There is no true discrimination between good and
evil.  The only question that arises is that of convenience in
respect of any proposed operation.  The whole of the moral and
religious lumber of the ages must be discarded for ever before
attempting Yoga.  You will find out only too soon what it means
to do wrong; by our very thesis itself all action is wrong.  Any
action is only relatively right in so far as it may help us to
put an end to the entire process of action.
<p>These relatively useful actions are therefore those which
make for control, or 'virtue.'  They have been classified, entirely
regardless of trouble and expense, in enormous volume, and with
the utmost complexity; to such a point, in fact, that merely to
permit oneself to study the nomenclature of the various systems
can have but one result:  to fuddle your brain for the rest of
your incarnation.
<p>4. I am going to try to simplify.  The main headings are:
<ol type=a>
<li>Asana, usually translated 'posture,' and
<LI>Pranayama, usually translated 'control of breath.'
</ol>
These translations, as usual, are perfectly wrong and inadequate.
The real object of Asana is control of the muscular system, conscious
and unconscious, so that no messages from the body can reach the
mind.  Asana is concerned with the static aspect of the body.
Pranayama is really the control of the dynamic aspect of the
body.
<P>
There is something a little paradoxical in the situation.  The
object of the process of Yoga is to stop all processes, including
itself.  But it is not sufficient for the Yogi to shoot himself,
because to do so would be to destroy the control, and so to release
the pain-producing energies.  We cannot enter into a metaphysical
discussion as to what it is that controls, or before we know where
we are we shall be moonstruck by hypotheses about the soul.

<p>5. Let us forget all this rubbish, and decide what is to be
done.  We have seen that to stop existing processes by an act
of violence is merely to release the undesirable elements.  If
we want peace on Dartmoor, we do not open the doors of the prison.
 What we do is to establish routine.  What is routine?  Routine
is rhythm.  If you want to go to sleep, you get rid of irregular,
unexpected noises.  What is wanted is a lullaby.  You watch sheep
going through a gate, or voters at a polling station.  When you
have got used to it, the regularity of the engines of a train
or steamship is soothing.  What we have to do with the existing
functions of the body is to make them so regular, with gradually
increasing slowness, that we become unconscious of their operation.
<p>6. Let us deal first with the question of Asana.  It might
be thought that nothing would be more soothing than swinging or
gentle massage.  In a sense, and up to a certain point, this is
so.  But the activity cannot be continued because fatigue supervenes,
and sooner or later the body protests by going to sleep.  We must,
therefore, make up our minds from the start to reduce bodily rhythm
to its minimum.
<p>7. I am not quite sure whether it is philosophically defensible,
whether it is logically justifiable, to assert the principles
of Asana as they occur in our practice.  We must break away from
our sorites, turn to the empiricism of experiment, and trust that
one day we may be able to work back from observed fact to a coherent
metaphysic.
<p>The point is that by sitting still, in the plain literal sense
of the words, the body does ultimately respond to the adjuration
of that great Mahatma, Harry Lauder, 'Stop your ticklin', Jock!'
<p>8. When we approach the details of Asana, we are immediately
confronted with the refuse-heap of Hindu pedantry.  We constantly
approach the traditional spiritual attitude of the late Queen
Victoria.  The only types of Asana which offer even the most transient
interest are those of which I am not going to speak at all, because
they have nothing whatever to do with the high-minded type of
Yoga which I am presenting to this distinguished audience.  I
should blush to do otherwise.  Anyhow, who wants to know about
these ridiculous postures?  If there is any fun in the subject
at all, it is the fun of finding them out.  I must admit that
if you start with a problem such as that of juxtaposing the back
of your head and shoulders with the back of the head and shoulders
of the other person concerned,<a href="8yoga4.htm#1">(*1)</a> the achievement does produce
a certain satisfaction.  But this, I think, is mostly vanity,
and it has nothing whatever to do, as I said before, with what
we are trying to talk about.
<p>9. The various postures recommended by the teachers of Yoga
depend for the most part upon the Hindu anatomy for their value,
and upon mystic theories concerning the therapeutic and thaumaturgic
properties ascribed to various parts of the body.  If, for instance,
you can conquer the nerve Udana, you can walk on water.  But who
the devil wants to talk on water?  Swimming is much better fun.
(I bar sharks, sting-rays, cuttle-fish, electric eels and piranhas.
Also trippers, bathing belles and Mr. Lansbury.)  Alternatively,
freeze the water and dance on it!  A great deal of Hindu endeavour
seems to consist in discovering the most difficult possible way
to attain the most undesirable end.
<p>10. When you start tying yourself into a knot, you will find
that some positions are much more difficult and inconvenient than
others; but that is only the beginning.  If you retain 'any' posture
long enough, you get cramp.  I forget the exact statistics, but
I gather that the muscular exertion made by a man sleeping peacefully
in bed is sufficient to raise fourteen elephants per hour to the
stratosphere.  Anyway, I remember that it is something rather
difficult to believe, if only because I did not believe it myself.
<p>11. Why then should we bother to choose a specially sacred
position?  Firstly, we want to be steady and easy.  We want, in
particular, to be able to do Pranayama in that position, if ever
we reach the stage of attempting that practice.  We may, therefore,
formulate (roughly speaking) the conditions to be desired in the
posture as follows:
<ol>
<LI>We want to be properly balanced.
<LI>We want our arms free.  (They are used in some Pranyama.)
<LI>We want our breathing apparatus as unrestrained as possible.
</ol>

Now, if you will keep these points in mind, and do not get side-tracked
by totally irrelevant ideas, such as to imagine that you are getting
holier by adopting some attitude traditionally appropriate to
a deity or holy man; and if you will refrain from the Puritan
abomination that anything is good for you if it hurts you enough,
you ought to be able to find out for yourself, after a few experiments,
some posture which meets these conditions.  I should very much
rather have you do this than come to me for some mumbo-jumbo kind
of authority.  I am no pig-sticking pukka sahib-not even from
Poona-to put my hyphenated haw-haw humbug over on the B. Public.<a href="8yoga4.htm#2">(*2)</a>
I would rather you did the thing 'wrong' by yourselves, and learned
from your errors, than get it 'right' from the teacher, and atrophied
your initiative and your faculty of learning anything at all.
<P>
It is, however, perfectly right that you should have some idea
of what happens when you sit down to practise.

<p>12. Let me digress for a moment and refer to what I said in
my text-book on Magick with regard to the formula IAO.  This formula
covers all learning.  You begin with a delightful feeling as of
a child with a new toy; you get bored, and you attempt to smash
it.  But if you are a wise child, you have had a scientific attitude
towards it, and you do <em>not</em> smash it.  You pass through the stage
of boredom, and arise from the inferno of torture towards the
stage of resurrection, when the toy has become a god, declared
to you its inmost secrets, and become a living part of your life.
There are no longer these crude, savage reactions of pleasure
and pain.  The new knowledge is assimilated.
<p>13. So it is with Asana.  The chosen posture attracts you;
you purr with self-satisfaction.  How clever you have been!  How
nicely the posture suits all conditions!  You absolutely melt
with maudlin good feeling.  I have known pupils who have actually
been betrayed into sparing a kindly thought for the Teacher! 
It is quite clear that there is something wrong about this.  Fortunately,
Time, the great healer, is on the job as usual; Time takes no
week-ends off;
<p>Time does not stop to admire himself; Time keeps right on.<a href="8yoga4.htm#3">(*3)</a>
Before very long, you forget all about the pleasantness of things,
and it would not be at all polite to give you any idea of what
you are going to think of the Teacher.
<p>14. Perhaps the first thing you notice is that, although you
have started in what is apparently the most comfortable position,
there is a tendency to change that position without informing
you.  For example, if you are sitting in the 'god' position with
your knees together, you will find in a few minutes that they
have moved gently apart, without your noticing it.  Freud would
doubtless inform you that this is due to an instinctive exacerbation
of infantile sexual theories.  I hope that no one here is going
to bother me with that sort of nauseating nonsense.
<p>15. Now it is necessary, in order to hold a position, to pay
attention to it.  That is to say:  you are going to become conscious
of your body in ways of which you are not conscious if you are
engaged in some absorbing mental pursuit, or even in some purely
physical activity, such as running.  It sounds paradoxical at
first sight, but violent exercise, so far from concentrating attention
on the body, takes it away.  That is because exercise has its
own rhythm; and, as I said, rhythm is half-way up the ridge to
Silence.
<p>Very good, then; in the comparative stillness of the body,
the student becomes aware of minute sounds which did not disturb
him in his ordinary life.  At least, not when his mind was occupied
with matters of interest.  You will begin to fidget, to itch,
to cough.  Possibly your breathing will begin to play tricks upon
you.  All these symptoms must be repressed.  The process of repressing
them is extremely difficult; and, like all other forms of repression,
it leads to a terrific exaggeration of the phenomena which it
is intended to repress.
<p>16. There are quite a lot of little tricks familiar to most
scientific people from their student days.  Some of them are very
significant in this connection of Yoga.  For instance, in the
matter of endurance, such as holding out a weight at arm's length,
you can usually beat a man stronger than yourself.  If you attend
to your arm, you will probably tire in a minute; if you fix your
mind resolutely on something else, you can go on for five minutes
or ten, or even longer.  It is a question of active and passive;
when Asana begins to annoy you the reply is to annoy it, to match
the active thought of controlling the minute muscular movement
against the passive thought of easing the irritation and disturbance.
<p>17. Now I do not believe that there are any rules for doing
this that will be any use to you.  There are innumerable little
tricks that you might try; only it is, as in the case of the posture
itself, rather better if you invent your own tricks.  I will only
mention one:  roll the tongue back towards the uvula, at the same
time let the eyes converge towards an imaginery point in the centre
of the forehead.  There are all sorts of holinesses indicated
in this attitude, and innumerable precedents on the part of the
most respectable divinities.  Do, please, forget all this nonsense!
The advantage is simply that your attention is forced to maintain
the awkward position.  You become aware sooner than you otherwise
would of any relaxation; and you thereby show the rest of the
body that it is no use trying to disturb you by its irritability.
<p>But there are no rules.  I said there weren't, and there aren't.
<P>
Only the human mind is so lazy and worthless that it is a positive
instinct to try to find some dodge to escape hard work.
<P>
These tricks may help or they may hinder; it is up to you to find
out which are good and which are bad, the why and the what and
all the other questions.  It all comes to the same thing in the
end.  There is only one way to still the body in the long run,
and that is to keep it still.  It's dogged as does it.

<p>18. The irritations develop into extreme agony.  Any attempt
to alleviate this simply destroys the value of the practice. 
I must particularly warn the aspirant against rationalising (I
<em>have</em> known people who were so hopelessly bat-witted that they
rationalised).  They thought:  'Ah, well, this position is not
suitable for me, as I thought it was.  I have made a mess of the
Ibis position; now I'll have a go at the Dragon position.'  But
the Ibis has kept his job, and attained his divinity, by standing
on one leg throughout the centuries.  If you go to the Dragon
he will devour you.
<p>19. It is through the perversity of human nature that the
most acute agony seems to occur when you are within a finger's
breadth of full success.  Remember Gallipoli!  I am inclined to
think that it may be a sort of symptom that one is near the critical
point when the anguish becomes intolerable.
<p>You will probably ask what 'intolerable' means.  I rudely
answer:  'Find out!'  But it may give you some idea of what is,
after all, not <em>too</em> bad, when I say that in the last months of
my own work it often used to take me ten minutes (at the conclusion
of the practice) to straighten my left leg.  I took the ankle
in both hands, and eased it out a fraction of a millimetre at
a time.
<p>20. At this point the band begins to play.  Quite suddenly
the pain stops.  An ineffable sense of relief sweeps over the
Yogi-notice that I no longer call him 'student' or 'aspirant'-and
he becomes aware of a very strange fact.  Not only was that position
giving him pain, but all other bodily sensations that he has ever
experienced are in the nature of pain, and were only borne by
him by the expedient of constant flitting from one to another.
<p>He is at ease; because, for the first time in his life, he
has become really unconscious of the body.  Life has been one
endless suffering; and now, so far as this particular Asana is
concerned, the plague is abated.
<P>
I feel that I have failed to convey the full meaning of this.
<P>
The fact is that words are entirely unsuitable.  The complete
and joyous awakening from the lifelong and unbroken nightmare
of physical discomfort is impossible to describe.
<p>21. The results and mastery of Asana are of use not only in
the course of attainment of Yoga, but in the most ordinary affairs
of life.  At any time when fatigued, you have only to assume your
Asana, and you are completely rested.  It is as if the attainment
of the mastery has worn down all those possibilities of physical
pain which are inherent in that particular position.  The teachings
of physiology are not contradictory to this hypothesis.
<p>The conquest of Asana makes for endurance.  If you keep in
constant practice, you ought to find that about ten minutes in
the posture will rest you as much as a good night's sleep.
<p>So much for the obstacle of the body considered as static.
Let us now turn our attention to the conquest of its dynamics.
<p>22. It is always pleasing to turn to a subject like Pranayama.
<P>
Pranayama means control of force.  It is a generalised term. 
In the Hindu system there are quite a lot of subtle sub-strata
of the various energies of the body which have all got names and
properties.  I do not propose to deal with the bulk of them. 
There are only two which have much practical importance in life.
One of these is not to be communicated to the public in a rotten
country like this; the other is the well-known 'control of breath.'
<P>
This simply means that you get a stop watch, and choose a cycle
of breathing out and breathing in.  Both operations should be
made as complete as possible.  The muscular system must be taxed
to its utmost to assist the expansion and contraction of the lungs.
<P>
When you have got this process slow and regular, for instance,
30 seconds breathing out and 15 in, you may add a few seconds
in which the breath is held, either inside or outside the lungs.
<P>
(It is said, by the way, that the operation of breathing out should
last about twice as long as that of breathing in, the theory being
that breathing out quickly may bring a loss of energy.  I think
there may be something in this.)

<p>23. There are other practices.  For instance, one can make
the breathing as quick and shallow as possible.  Any good practice
is likely to produce its own phenomena, but in accordance with
the general thesis of these lectures I think it will be obvious
that the proper practice will aim at holding the breath for as
long a period as possible-because that condition will represent
as close an approximation to complete stillness of the physiological
apparatus as may be.  Of course we are not stilling it; we are
doing nothing of the sort.  But at least we are deluding ourselves
into thinking that we are doing it, and the point is that, according
to tradition, if you can hold the mind still for as much as twelve
seconds you will get one of the highest results of Yoga.  It is
certainly a fact that when you are doing a cycle of 20 seconds
out, 10 in, and 30 holding, there is quite a long period during
the holding period when the mind does tend to stop its malignant
operations.  By the time this cycle has become customary, you
are able to recognise instinctively the arrival of the moment
when you can throw yourself suddenly into the mental act of concentration.
In other words, by Asana and Pranayama you have worked yourself
into a position where you are free, if only for a few seconds,
to attempt actual Yoga processes, which you have previously been
prevented from attempting by the distracting activities of the
respiratory and muscular systems.
<p>24. And so?  Yes.  Pranayama may be described as nice clean
fun.  Before you have been doing it very long, things are pretty
certain to begin to happen, though this, I regret to remark, is
fun to you, but death to Yoga.
<p>The classical physical results of Pranayama are usually divided
into four stages:
<p>1. Perspiration.  This is not the ordinary perspiration which
comes from violent exercise; it has peculiar properties, and I
am not going to tell you what these are, because it is much better
for you to perform the practices, obtain the experience, and come
to me yourself with the information.  In this way you will know
that you have got the right thing, whereas if I were to tell you
now, you would very likely imagine it.
<p>2. Automatic rigidity:  the body becomes still, as the result
of a spasm.  This is perfectly normal and predictable.  It is
customary to do it with a dog.  You stick him in a bell-jar, pump
in oxygen or carbonic acid or something, and the dog goes stiff.
 You can take him out and wave him around by a leg as if he were
frozen.  This is not quite the same thing, but near it.

<p>25. Men of science are terribly handicapped in every investigation
by having been trained to ignore the immeasurable.  All phenomena
have subtle qualities which are at present insusceptible to any
properly scientific methods of investigation.  We can imitate
the processes of nature in the laboratory, but the imitation is
not always exactly identical with the original.  For instance,
Professor J. B. S. Haldane attempted some of the experiments suggested
in 'The Equinox' in this matter of Pranayama, and very nearly
killed himself in the process.  He did not see the difference
between the experiment with the dog and the phenomena which supervene
as the climax of a course of gentle operation.  It is the difference
between the exhilaration produced by sipping Clos Vougeot '26
and the madness of swilling corn whiskey.  It is the same foolishness
as to think that sniffing cocaine is a more wholesome process
than chewing coca leaves.  Why, they exclaim, cocaine is chemically
pure!  Cocaine is the active principle!  We certainly do not want
these nasty leaves, where our sacred drug is mixed up with a lot
of vegetable stuff which rather defies analysis, and which cannot
possibly have any use for that reason!  This automatic rigidity,
or Shukshma Khumbakham, is not merely to be defined as the occurrence
of physiological rigidity.  That is only the grosser symptom.
<p>26. The third stage is marked by Buchari-siddhi:  'the power
of jumping about like a frog' would be a rough translation of
this fascinating word.  This is a very extraordinary phenomenon.
You are sitting tied up on the floor, and you begin to be wafted
here and there, much as dead leaves are moved by a little breeze.
This does happen; you are quite normal mentally, and you can
watch yourself doing it.
<p>The natural explanation of this is that your muscles are making
very quick short spasmodic jerks without your being conscious
of the fact.  The dog helps us again by making similar contortions.
As against this, it may be argued that your mind appears to be
perfectly normal.  There is, however, one particuliar point of
consciousness, the sensation of almost total loss of weight. 
This, by the way, may sound a little alarming to the instructed
alienist.  There is a similar feeling which occurs in certain
types of insanity.

<p>27. The fourth state is Levitation.  The Hindus claim that
'jumping about like a frog' implies a genuine loss of weight,
and that the jumping is mainly lateral because you have not perfected
the process.  If you were absolutely balanced, they claim that
you would rise quietly into the air.
<P>
I do not know about this at all.  I never saw it happen.  On the
other hand, I have often felt as if it were happening; and on
three occasions at least comparatively reliable people have said
that they saw it happening to me.  I do not think it proves anything.
<P>
These practices, Asana and Pranayama, are, to a certain extent,
mechanical, and to that extent it is just possible for a man of
extraordinary will power, with plenty of leisure and no encumbrances,
to do a good deal of the spade-work of Yoga even in England. 
But I should advise him to stick very strictly to the purely physical
preparation, and on no account to attempt the practices of concentration
proper, until he is able to acquire suitable surroundings.
<P>
But do not let him imagine that in making this very exceptional
indulgence I am going to advocate any slipshod ways.  If he decides
to do, let us say, a quarter of an hour's Asana twice daily, rising
to an hour four times daily, and Pranayama in proportion, he has
got to stick to this-no cocktail parties, football matches, or
funerals of near relations, must be allowed to interfere with
the routine.  The drill is the thing, the acquisition of the habit
of control, much more important than any mere success in the practices
themselves.  I would rather you wobbled about for your appointed
hour than sat still for fifty-nine minutes.  The reason for this
will only be apparent when we come to the consideration of advanced
Yoga, a subject which may be adequately treated in a second series
of four lectures.  By special request only, and I sincerely hope
that nothing of the sort will happen.

<p>29. Before proposing a vote of thanks to the lecturer for
his extraordinarily brilliant exposition of these most difficult
subjects, I should like to add a few words on the subject of
Mantra-Yoga, because this is really a branch of Pranayama, and
one which it is possible to practise quite thoroughly in this
country.  In Book IV., Part I., I have described it, with examples,
quite fully enough.  I need here only say that its constant use,
day and night, without a moment's cessation, is probably as useful
a method as one could find of preparing the current of thought
for the assumption of a rhythmical form, and rhythm is the great
cure for irregularity.  Once it is established, no interference
will prevent it.  Its own natural tendency is to slow down, like
a pendulum, until time stops, and the sequence of impressions
which constitutes our intellectual apprehensions of the universe
is replaced by that form of consciousness (or unconsciousness,
if you prefer it, not that either would give the slightest idea
of what is meant) which is without condition of any kind, and
therefore represents in perfection the consummation of Yoga.
