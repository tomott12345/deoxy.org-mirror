<h1><font size=+4>The Clear White Light
<br><font size=-1>by Master Subramuniya</font></font></h1>
A Western Mystic's transcendental experiences</center>
<blockquote>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  The experience of the clear white light is a mystical vision seen with
the mind's eye as vividly as one would see with the physical eyes. We are
always seeing light with the third eye in some degree. Close your eyes and
envision a large tree standing alone upon a hill covered with flowers
bursting out of lush green grass in the field around. Imagine the scene
taking place on a sunny day; the clear crisp air in the high altitude
brings forth the images distinctly. Put a cloud in the sky for contrast.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  The light you have been seeing, as you have been creating these suggested
images, one at a time, with your thoughts inspired by what you have been
reading, is the inner light flooding through the external mind. Remove the
cloud from the picture - the flowers, the grass, and the tree. Inner light
alone would remain. This inner light intensified one thousand times would
be called "the clear white light".

<h3>The Clear White Light</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Whenever man comes to a point in his evolution where he has sufficient
mastery in the <a href="cwl.htm#mind">mind</a> to produce "things", he suffers for the lack of
peace. In his activities on the mental spheres in conceiving, planning,
gathering the forces together, and finally viewing the outcome as a physical
manifestation, he has exercised an intricate control over the nerve fibers
of his <a  href="cwl.htm#aware">awareness</a>. Thus caught in this pattern, he must keep on producing to ensure his mental security, for, should he stop for a moment, the whiplash
upon his senses as the generative functions of the third dimension cease
to be active would cause paranoic depressions, sometimes almost beyond
repair. The man looking into the where and when of the future, blending his
energies with those who are also striving to evolve into a more ramified
state of awareness can easily suffer if he keeps going, producing, aquiring,
and believing that materiality is reality. Evolution of the species takes
its toll, for as man's awareness expands, he is no longer content projecting
into the where and when of the material <a href="cwl.htm#con">consciousness</a>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  As he seeks some reward of peace for his efforts, he begins to look into
the past for solutions, the there and then of it all. He finds himself born
into a cross section of awareness between past and future, having
experienced both of these tendencies of the mind, and this causes him to
reflect. Philosophy holds few answers for him. Its congested mass of
"shoulds" and "don'ts", though profound if followed, he knows have proved
more to the philosopher who clarified his own thinking about them on paper
than to the reader who has yet to complement with inner knowing its
indicated depths. Occultism is intriguing to him, for it shows that there
are possibilities of expression beyond the senses he has become well
accustomed to using. But again evolution, rounding his vision, causes him
to discard the occult symbolism, laws, and practices as another look into
the past or future of the mind's depths.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  The idea of yoga, union through perceptive control of the flow of
thought, and of the generative processes of a perceptive idea before
thought is formed, is most satisfying. The cognition of the 
<a href="cwl.htm#acti">actinic</a> processes, or his life currents, intrigues him, and he looks further into the practive of <a href="cwl.htm#ay">Advaita Yoga</a> techniques and finds that peace is gained through a conscious government, first, of the life currents through the
body, and second, of the realms of ideas as they flow into thought. And
while remaining the observer of it all in the eternity of the here and now,
he fully realizes that time, space, and causation are only indicated
through holding an off-balanced consciousness of past and future.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  The feeling and realization of the here and now intensity of
consciousness becomes intriguing to him, and he works daily with Advaita
Yoga techniques to strengthen psychic nerve fibers and perfect his artistry
in maintaining this awareness. Many things fall away from him as he expands
his consciousness through the classical practices of meditation. He loosens
the <a href="cwl.htm#odic">odic</a> bonds of family and former friends; magnetic ties to possessions and places fade out until he is alone - involved only in the refined realms
of mind and in the actinic flow of energies. Even if, occasionally, his
awareness is brought into a habit pattern or a concept of himself as he
used to be, he views it with his new stability in his recently found inner
security of being whole. But this, too, quickly fades.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Whenever darkness comes into the material world, it does not affect this
centered, enlightened man. He sees light within his head and body as clearly
as he does when in states of materialistic consciousness he looks at a
glowing light bulb. While involved in innersearching some hidden laws of
existence or unraveling the solution to a problem of the outer dimensions
of the mind, he sits viewing the inner light, and the light shines through
the knitted law of existence clearly, showing it in all its ramifications
as well as shining out upon the snarled problem and burning it back into
proportionate component parts.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Thus becoming <a href="cwl.htm#adept">adept</a> in using his newly found faculties, be begins to study the findings of others and compares them to his own. This educational
playback process elucidates to his still doubting intellect the "all
rightness" of the happenings that occur within him. He finds that during
the past eight thousand years men have from time to time walked the path of
enlightenment, and he begins to see that he has yet far to go as his light
often is dimmed by the pulling he experiences from the past, by the
exuberance he shares with the future, and yet the fawn-like instability of
the "here and now" eternity he has most recently experienced.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Now, in the <a href="cwl.htm#aqua">Aquarian Age</a>, when many men are being drawn within, it is emminently easier to attain and maintain clarity of perception through the
<a href="cwl.htm#actil">actinic light</a> within the body. Only a short time ago man looked at the external world through his physical eyes and registered it as real. Social
and cultural structures were the controlling forces. Now a new race, the
actinic race, looks through the veil of the outer mind and sees the game of
it all, inevitably finding that when the rules are known the game may be
entered into joyfully, resulting in winning applause. For through the
Advaita Yoga techniques perfecting the conscious use of the will power, the
energies can be drawn inward from the outer mind, and awareness can bask in
the actinic light, coming into the outer mind only at will, and positively.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Occasionally young aspirants burst into experience indicating a balance
of intense light at a still higher rate of vibration of here and now
awareness than their almost daily experience of a moon-glow inner light. It
is the dynamic vision of clairvoyantly seeing the head, and at times the
body, filled with a brilliant clear light. When this intensity can be
attained at will, more than often man will identify himself as the actinic
force flowing through the odic externalities of the outer mind and
understand it as a force of life more real and infinitely more permanent
than the external mind itself. Occasionally, through his newly unfolded
extrasensory perception, he may clairaudibly hear, within, the seven sounds
he previously studied in occult lore. The sounds of the atomic structure of
his nerve system and cells register as voices singing or as music of the
vina, of the sita, or of the tambura. Instruments to duplicate these sounds
for the outer ears were carefully tooled by the Himalayan <a href="cwl.htm#rishi">rishi</a>s of Asvaita Yoga thousands of years ago, including the boom and jill of the tabla, and
the flute.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  As psychic centers in his cranium burst open, he will hear the shrill
note, likened to a nightingale singing, and then an inner voice, indicating
direction and elucidation to his external consciousness like a breath of
air. This inner voice remains with him as a permanent yoga of the external
consciousness, an ever-ready guide to the unraveling of complexities in
daily life. Should he come out too far into materialistic consciousness,
the inner voice may be falsely identified as an unseen master or a god
talking into his right ear, but, when in the clarity of clairvoyantly
seeing white light and at the same time clairaudibly hearing the inner
sounds, he knows that it is his superconsciousness, his inner self.
Occasionally, in a cross section of the sixth dimension of the inner
mind, when light merges into transcendental form, the young aspirant may
view the golden actinic face of a master peering into his, kindly and
all-knowing. He is looking at his own great potential.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  When <a href="cwl.htm#eftya">eftya</a>, the clear white light, becomes more of a friend to his external mind than merely an occasional vision or experience and can be basked in during the four contemplative <a href="cwl.htm#tyaa">tyaasem</a> periods of the day, then
the nourishment to the entire nervoius system, as ambrosia, bursts forth from the crown chakra, <a href="cwl.htm#kamma">kammakadeesareh</a> <a href="cwl.htm#kash">kashumlinga</a>. This is sometimes identified as "the peace that passeth understanding", but he who reaches
this state can never explain it adequately. The highly trained Advaita Yoga adept, through techniques imparted to him from his <a href="cwl.htm#guru">guru</a>, intensifies the
clear white light to the brink of God-Realization, Emkael. His entire
body is faded into a sea of blue-white light, where present, past, and
future are recorded in the linear depths, or layers. He sometimes sees
himself seated or standing on a lotus flower of shimmering light, in an
<a href="cwl.htm#actin">actinodic</a> clear transparent neon plastic-like body outline as his
consciousness touches in the rhythm of a heart's beat into the Self,
<a href="cwl.htm#emkaef">Emkaef</a>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Keeping this continuity alive and not allowing the external consciousness
to reign, the young aspirant lives daily in the clear white light, eftya,
having occasionally more intense experiences as just described, until he
attains the maturity of the nerve fibers essential to burst his awareness
beyond itself into the ultimate attainment of Self-Realization, Emkaef.
This is only known and identified by him as an experience experienced. It
is only recognized by others as he maintains his point of reference: the
mind is only illusion, everchanging and perpetuating itself by mingling
concepts of past and future into the present; the only reality is timeless,
formless, causeless, spaceless, the Self beyond the mind. He knows that the
mind is made from a consciousness of time, and that is creates, maintains,
and defabricates form and exists in a relative concept of space. The Self
is the only reality and is an intensity far greater than that of any phase
of the mind.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  The young aspirant just becoming acquainted with the path of
enlightenment may wonder where he is and how much he has achieved so far.
There are a few cardinal signposts with which he may identify to know he
has touched into the inner realms of his mind. Should he ever have
experienced a here and now consciousness so intensely that the reaction to
the experience can cause states of depression, he can fully impart to
himself an award of achievement. Then he must decide to strive even more
diligently than before to maintain a conscious awareness of the here and
now. The ability to see the expernal world as transparent, a game, a dream,
encourages the aspirant to seek more deeply. When the moon-glow light
within the center of his head appears during his tries at meditation, he
may acquire the perceptive ability to cognize intimately the inticate
workings of another's external and subconscious states of mind as well as
his own. His ability to recognize his guru and identify himself in the
actinic flow from whence the master infuses knowledge by causing inner
doors to open is another signpost that the aspirant has become an
experiencer and is touching in on the fringe or perimeter of transcendental
states of mind.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Many on the path of enlightenment will be able to identify some of these
signposts through their personal experience and recall many happenings that
occurred during their awakenings. But remember, the recall and the
experience are quite different. The experience is here and now; the recall
is there and then. However, by identifying the experience and relating it
to a solid intellectual knowledge, the ability will be awakened to utilize
and live consciously in states of superconsciousness. After acquiring the
ability to consciously live superconsciously, one is then able to work
accurately and enthusiastically in the materially structured world, while
holding the intensity of the inner light. When one gains perceptive
awareness into the mechanical structures of the world, he is able to work
out quickly in meditation experiences of the external mind or worldly
happening through finding their <a href="cwl.htm#inner">innerversity</a> aspects, rather than being drawn out into the swirl of them. In doing so, the cause and effect,
<a href="cwl.htm#simm">simmereh</a>, experiential patterns of the aspirant's life that tend to
externalize awareness into congested areas of the mind will clear up, as
more and more of the actinic flow of superconsciousness is maintained and
as the bursts of eftya become frequent.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Those among the youth of today - and there are many - who have had some
measure of attainment will be the leaders, businessmen, politicians, and
educators of tomorrow as the Aquarian Age comes more into fulfillment. They
will be able to work effectively in all states of the mind. They will
consciously identify from the clarity of their vision with the overwhelming
power of the white light within the body and through the mind. Still others
will become the mendicant renunciates, sages, the <a href="cwl.htm#cata">catalyst teachers</a>, 
the pundit philosophers, all working as individuals together to keep the
perspective and teachings of the path of enlightenment alive and vibrant on
the earth yet another eight thousand years.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Remember, when the seal of the kammakadeesareh kashumlinga is broken and
eftya, clear white light, has flooded the awareness of the aspirant, there
is no more a gap between the inner and the outer. After this experience,
when awareness is entangled in uncomplimentary states of the external mind,
it can refocus within through meditation and move into eftya, the clear
white light. The aspirant can be aware that in having a newfound freedom
internally and externally, there will be a strong tendency for the
subconscious mind to reconstruct for itself a new congested program by
reacting strongly to happenings during daily experiences. Even though one
may think one is playing the games of external life, there is a tendency of
the instinctive phases of nature to fall prey to the cumulative reactions
caused by entering into them.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Therefore, an experience of inner light is not a solution; one or two
bursts of eftya, clear white light, are only a door opener to
transcendental possibilities. The young aspirant must become the
experiencer, not the one who has experienced and basks in the memory
patterns it caused. This is where discipline enters into the life and
vocabulary of this blooming flower. This is why monasteries house disciples
apart for a time. Under discipline, they become experiencers, fragmenting
their entanglements before their vision daily while they do some mundane
chore and complete each test and task that is set before them. The 
<a href="cwl.htm#natya">natya</a> is taught to withdraw his reactionary habit patterns in eftya, the clear white light, four times each day - during the <a href="cwl.htm#kanef">kanef</a> tyaasem - at six in the morning, twelve noon, six in the evening, and twelve midnight. He clears the reactionary conditions that inevitably occur during the day with actinic love and understanding so that they do not congest of condense in his subconscious mind. Otherwise a new set of confused congested forces
would build up and propel him into third dimensional outer states of consciousness, leaving his vision of eftya as an experience in memory patterns retreating into the past.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  The young aspirant can use this elementary Advaita Yoga technique of
going over the day at the end of the day in an internal concentration
period, holding his awareness in the thought flow of just the current daily
experience, not allowing it to waver into unrelated thought areas. When a
reactionary condition appears that was not resolved with love and
understanding during the day, it will melt away, usually, under the power
of a perceptive flash of understanding, as the aspirant turns to the inner
light.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Thousands of young aspirants who have had bursts of inner light have
evolved quickly. Assuredly, this has been their natural, though sudden,
flow of evolvement as it has occurred. This oversensitization of their
entire consciousness so suddenly intensified into transcendental realms has
caused the materialistic states to decentralize the attachments of their
present life pattern, educational interests, and plans for the future. A
springboard is needed, a new balance must be attained; that is, a new
balance in relating to the materialistic world, for the physical body must
still be cared for to unfold further into the human destiny of Emkaef, the
realization of the self beyond all five states of mind. Enlightened seers
are turning inward to find new ways of bringing forth knowledge from inner
realms to meet creatively man's basic needs and to bring through to the
external spheres the beauty and culture found only on inner planes. Thus
are heralded the Golden Age of tommorrow and the illuminated beings of the
future who, through the use of their disciplined third eye and other
faculties, can remain "within", within eftya, the clear white light, while
working accurately and enthusiastically on the material plane seeing it all
the time as the obvious dream world.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  When the aspirant realizes that he is the force that propels him onward,
he will welcome discipline as an intricate part of his internal government
so necessary to being eftya.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  It is a great new world of the mind that is entered into when first eftya
dawns, giving birth to a new actinic race and immediately causing the
aspirant to become, in inner consciousness, the parent to his parents and
his grandparents. When he lives in the fourth and fifth dimensions, in an
expanded inner state of consciousness, he must not expect those living in
<a href="cwl.htm#dawmf">dawmf</a> and <a href="cwl.htm#dawf">dawf</a>, third dimensional 
materialistic consciousness, to 
understand him. On this new path of "the lonely one", wisdom must be
invoked to be able to look through the eyes of those who believe the world
is real, and see and relate to that limited world in working with them as
if it were real, thus maintaining the harmony so necessary for future
unfoldments. To try to convince those imbedded in materialism of the inner
realities, only causes a breach in relationship, because it represents a
positive threat to the subconscious security they have worked so hard to
obtain.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  First we had the instinctive age of valuing physical strength and manly
prowess, followed by the intellectual age, facts for the sake of facts,
resulting in the progress of science. Now we are in an age of new values,
new governing laws, an actinic age, with a new understanding of the world,
the mind, and most of all, the Self, beyond eftya. Understanding is
preparation for travel, for it is an age of the mind, and in the mind, much
more intense than the speed of light, exist spheres which rishis and seers
are only willing to speak of to those who have the inner ear with which to
listen.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  The individual awareness of man tends either toward light or toward
darkness, expanded awareness or materialistic values. Depending upon the
self-created conditions of his consciousness, man lives either within
eftya, the clear white light of the deep consciousness, or in the external
mind structure which casts darkness upon his inner vision.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  The un<a href="cwl.htm#ini">initiate</a>d might ask: "What is it like to be in eftya?" The young aspirant may reply, "It is as simple as sitting in a darkened room, closing
the eyes in deep concentration and finding the entire inside of the cranium
turning into clear white light." At first it may be only a dim, moon-like
glow, a pale flicker of several different colors, but then it becomes as
bright and intense as the radiance of the noonday sun, then crystal clear
and white. It depends upon the composition of the mind's states of
reactionary patterns as to how the light in the cranium will first
appear.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Of course, eftya is not absolute, for it is found in the fifth dimension
of the mind. Light invariably implies the existence of shadow, the third
dimension. The shadows that sometimes dim inner light are the instinctive
functions that hold the physical body intact. These are represented as
attributes in the external mind and character of man.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Attachment, for instance, holds our cells together; it is also the root
of much suffering, because attachment to material objects or people keeps
man's awareness externalized, incapable of expressing itself in full
freedom. Man who is caught in the magnetic forces of the third dimension of
the mind is prone to resentment. Not being able to cognize various fears as
they occur, he stores them up into a conscious resentment of all threats to
the false securities found in attachment. Resentment burrows deeply into
the outer subconscious layers, undermining much of a person's creative
endeavor. The reactionary conditions resentment is capable of agitating are
subconscious and cast many shadows over clarity of perception for long
periods of time.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Those who resent are often jealous, another shadow or character weakness
which stems from feelings of inferiority, a limited view of one's inner
self. After one burst of eftya has occurred, the force fields of
attachment, resentment, and jealousy are shattered. As increased control of
awareness is gained, an expanded consciousness is maintained which frees
man little by little from ever again generating the magnetic holds
consuming his consciousness in these shadows.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  When man allows his external thinking and action to settle into
uncreative static conditions, pressures build up, and the undisciplined
subconscious releases itself to anger, an emotion which renders a man blind
to the existence of inner light in any degree.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Fear is another shadow which causes man to be unable to face a critical
moment, even in the intimacy of his deepest meditation. But fear is a
protective process of the instinctive mind, which allows time to avoid
temporarily what must later be faced. Fear, an intense force in the mind's
structure, as well as the body's, must be handled positively, for when man
thinks under the shadow of fear he causes his fears to be manifest. The
flickering shadows of worry brought on by allowing awareness to jump
irrationally in the external mind from one subject to another, never
focusing on any one point long enough to complete it, must be handled
through disciplining the flow of awareness in the external mind. Worry
provokes the darker shadow - fear. Fear, when disturbed, causes anger,
resentment, causes a jealous nature. Hence, the constant play of awareness
between eftya, and the shadows.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  By becoming conscious of the way in which the mind operates in even a
small degree, the young aspirant to light finds it easy to fold back the
shadows into shafts of clear white light.
<a name="meditate">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Eftya <a href="cwl.htm#ook">Ookanashum</a></h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  When we are in ideal surroundings in the rehnam, we can balance the
passive and the active currents of the body - the physical energies of the
body and the intellectual thought energies. First, do the simple pranayama
of breathing easily in and out in an even rhythm, nine beats to the
inhalation, hold one beat, and nine beats to the exhalation, hold the
breath for one beat. This steady rhythm will soon begin to transmute the
thought energies and forces and you move into the state of pure awareness
aware only of itself.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  As the thought energies become quieted and regulated, you will hear a
ringing about an inch above the right ear. This is the sound of the nerve
current of the thought energy. And as the body energy becomes quieted and
regulated through sitting quietly, you will hear a ringing about an inch
above the left ear. This is the nerve sound of the physical energies of the
body, slightly different from the tone of the thought energy. The direction
of the thought energy flow is up; whereas the body energy flows downward.
When the energy in the two is balanced, a circle is formed, creating a
force field in which the pure life force flowing through the spine and out
into the nerve system is regulated.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Now, to bring the life force into power, listen to both tones
simultaneously. It may take you about five minutes to hear both tones at
the same time. Next, follow both tonal vibrations from the ears into the
center of the cranium, where they will meet and blend into a slightly
different sound, as two notes, say an "A" and an "E", blend into a chord.
The energy of these two currents is then flowing in a circle, and you will
enter the golden yellow light of the life force current. Play with this
light and bask in its radiance, for in it is your bloom. The unfoldment
progresses from a golden yellow to a clear white light. Should you see a
blue light, know that you are in the thought current. If you see a pink
light, that is the color of the body energy. Just disregard them and seek the
white light, in the tone of the combined currents until finally you do not
hear the tone anymore and you fully burst into the clear white light. Thus
you enter intense experience of awareness aware only of itself, on brink of
the Absolute. Samadhi with seed or consciousness, which is the culmination of
this particular practice in contemplation.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  After doing this for a period of time, you will find that the exterior
world will seem transparent and unreal to you. When this happens you have
to learn to bring your consciousness back through meditation deliberately
into the processes of inner knowing and thought, and back into the exterior
world through concentration, to make the exterior world seem real again.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Now is the time for students who have worked diligently in concentration
and meditation and in clearing up personal problems to enjoy the contemplative
life and be happy in their attainment of the bliss that is their heritage
on earth.
