In the early 1960s Harvard University psychologist [Local:Leary Timothy Leary], who later morphed into a counterculture guru, proposed that psychedelic trips are shaped by &quot;set and setting.&quot; Set is mind-set, your overall psychic makeup as well as your expectations, hopes, fears. Setting is, well, setting—meaning the trip's locale as well as cultural context. If you think your trip will help you overcome alcoholism, obsessive-compulsive disorder, melancholy or fear of death, there is a chance it will, especially if you are tended by a caring therapist in a safe, clinical setting. Given the right set and setting, you might even have a religious experience.

Now we are seeing evidence that exactly as described by traditional healers, these agents do in fact offer benefits for mind and mood. Interesting enough, magic mushrooms, peyote buttons and the ayahuasca brew are all referred to by those who employ them as “The Medicine,” for their broad purported healing benefits.

One of the participants had come to the realization through the psilocibin treatment that she had been allowing her fear of the future to destroy her present.

He was best known for what’s called the “Good Friday Experiment,” conducted in April 1962 as part of his doctoral thesis on religion. Prior to the Good Friday service at the Boston University Marsh Chapel that year, volunteer divinity students from the Boston area split into two groups. The members of one group were given doses of psilocybin — a drug produced by hallucinogenic mushrooms — while members of the other group were given placebos. Nine out of the 10 students given the psychedelic drug reported “profound religious experiences,” offering Pahnke what he took to be empirical evidence that psilocybin is a reliable trigger for spiritual awakenings.

In this, the seeds of a psychedelic renaissance were planted.

The authors interviewed 53 cluster headache patients who had used psilocybin or lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) to treat their condition. Twenty-two of 26 psilocybin users reported that psilocybin aborted attacks; 25 of 48 psilocybin users and 7 of 8 LSD users reported cluster period termination; 18 of 19 psilocybin users and 4 of 5 LSD users reported remission period extension. Research on the effects of psilocybin and LSD on cluster headache may be warranted.

;Guardian Unlimited:'''[http://www.guardian.co.uk/drugs/Story/0,,1754089,00.html Lancet calls for LSD in labs]'''

Dr Horton told Guardian Unlimited that important advances were made by [Deoxy:shamansci.htm researchers using psychedelic drugs on themselves], but that these studies were stifled by the post-1960s anti-drug backlash. &quot;Our very earliest understanding of the neurochemistry of the brain came from studying LSD-like compounds. Those same researchers were also taking those drugs, not recreationally, but as experiments on themselves. This was immensely important work.&quot;

;The Lancet:'''[http://www.maps.org/sys/nq.pl?id=811&amp;fmt=page Reviving research into psychedelic drugs]'''

That psychedelic drugs, such as LSD and MDMA (ecstasy), can be effective treatments for various psychiatric illnesses is an old idea. Once considered wonder drugs for their effects on anxiety, depression, alcoholism, and other mental illnesses, they have been effectively banished from medical practice after legal rulings banned their sale and use...the social prescription against psychedelic drugs that hinders properly controlled research into their effects and side-effects is largely based on social and legal, as opposed to scientific, concerns.

When Kevin Herbert has a particularly intractable programming problem, or finds himself pondering a big career decision, he deploys a powerful mind expanding tool--LSD-25.

&quot;It must be changing something about the internal communication in my brain. Whatever my inner process is that lets me solve problems, it works differently, or maybe different parts of my brain are used,&quot; said Herbert, 42, an early employee of Cisco Systems who says he solved his toughest technical problems while tripping to drum solos by the Grateful Dead--who were among the many artists inspired by LSD.

&quot;When I'm on LSD and hearing something that's pure rhythm, it takes me to another world and into anther brain state where I've stopped thinking and started knowing,&quot; said Herbert who intervened to ban drug testing of technologists at Cisco Systems.

&quot;It is as if a whole generation of psychiatrists have had this systematically erased from their education,&quot; Dr Sessa says. &quot;But for the generation who trained in the 50s and 60s, this really was going to be the next big thing. Thousands of books and papers were written, but then it all went silent. My generation has never heard of it. It's almost as if there has been an active demonisation.&quot;

&quot;I don't see either ethically or professionally or technically why it shouldn't be used in the future,&quot; Dr Sandison says. &quot;But anything done now has to be very different from what we did. All the expertise developed in those years by a large number of people has been lost so we have to start again.&quot;

Patients who suffer from cluster headaches--a debilitating medical condition for which there is no cure--are flouting the government's ban on magic mushrooms because they say the psychedelic fungi are the only thing to relieve the pain of their attacks...ergotomine--which contains lysergic acid, a precursor of LSD--has been used to treat migraines for years.

;British Journal of Psychiatry:'''[http://www.maps.org/sys/nq.pl?id=539&amp;fmt=page Can Psychedelics Have A Role In Psychiatry Again?]'''

In the years between the first synthesis of LSD in the 1930s--and the disappearance of psychedelic research by the late 1960s, there was a furious growth of scientific interest in these substances. Many pioneers gave their careers to this field, hoping that psychedelic drugs could be the Holy Grail for psychiatry--like the microscope is to biology or the telescope is to astronomy--an essential tool to explore the parts of the internal world that are usually inaccessible...

By 1965 over 2000 papers had been published describing positive results for over 40,000 patients, taking psychedelic drugs with few side effects and a high level of safety. The techniques were applied to the treatment of anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, depression, bereavement reactions and sexual dysfunction, among others.  In the treatment of addiction, repeated controlled experiments demonstrated a consistent recovery and 6 month abstinence from drinking in 50% to 90% of subjects after brief psychedelic therapy...

Perhaps a more dispassionate criticism based upon scientific reasoning and not influenced by social or political pressures is called for if we are to truly investigate whether these substances can have a useful role in psychiatry today.

;Psychology Today:'''[http://psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-20050422-000005.html Psychedelics in Rehab]'''

Should psychedelic drugs be used for tough-to-treat conditions? Studying contraband substances are on the upswing, and many say it should have happened sooner. 

Researchers hope this is only the beginning of a hallucinogenic data mine. As Grob also points out, &quot;People forget, but psychedelics were the cutting edge of science in this country for 50 years.&quot; In fact, in the 1940s and '50s, so much money flowed in this direction that many top researchers got their start in this field. Many feel modern psychiatry owes its origins to the study of hallucinogens.

After all, it was the discovery of the neurotransmitter serotonin--thanks to LSD--that jump started the brain chemistry revolution.

In 1962 psychiatrist Sven Jensen, working in Weyburn, Saskatchewan, published the first controlled trial involving LSD and alcoholism...In his 2-year study involving follow-up periods of 6 to 18 months, Jensen evaluated patients treated for chronic alcoholism according to 3 different methods. The study results showed that 38 of the 58 patients treated with LSD remained abstinent in the follow-up period. These numbers were striking when compared with those who received only group therapy (7 of 38 remained abstinent) and those who were treated by other psychiatrists (4 of 35 remained abstinent).
