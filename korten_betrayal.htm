<blockquote>

<H1>The Betrayal Of Adam Smith</H1>

From <I>When Corporations Rule the World</I> by David C. Korten<br>
Kumarian Press and Berrett-Koehler Publishers, 1995<br>

<P>
Proponents of <a href="korten_assault.htm"><I>corporate libertarianism</I></a> regularly pay homage to Adam Smith as their intellectual patron saint. His writing remains to this day the
intellectual foundation of policies advanced in the name of market freedom that
are allowing a few hundred corporations to consolidate their control over
markets all over the world. See <I><A HREF="korten_failure.htm">An Economic System
Dangerously Out of Control</A>.</I>

<P>
Ironically, Smith's epic work <I>The Wealth of Nations,</I> which was first
published in 1776, presents a radical condemnation of business monopolies
sustained and protected by the state. Adam Smith's ideal was a market comprised
solely of small buyers and sellers. He showed how the workings of such a market
would tend toward a price that provides a fair return to land, labor, and
capital, produce a satisfactory outcome for both buyers and sellers, and result
in an optimal outcome for society in terms of the allocation of its resources.
He made clear, however, that this outcome can result only when no buyer or
seller is sufficiently large to influence the market price&#151;a point many who
invoke his name prefer not to mention. Such a market implicitly assumes a
significant degree of equality in the distribution of economic power&#151;another
widely neglected point.  
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Smith was almost fanatical in his opposition to any kind of monopoly
power, which he defined as the power of a seller to maintain a price for an
indefinite time above its natural price. Indeed, he asserted that trade secrets
confer a monopoly advantage and are contrary to the principles of a free market.
He would surely have strongly opposed current efforts by market libertarians to
strengthen corporate monopoly control of intellectual property rights through
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The idea that a major
corporation might have exclusive control over a lifesaving drug or device and
thereby be able to charge whatever the market will bear would have been anathema
to him.  
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Smith did not advocate a market system based on unrestrained greed.
He was talking about small farmers and artisans trying to get the best price for
their products to provide for themselves and their families. That is
self-interest&#151;but it is not greed. Greed is a high paid corporate executive
firing 10,000 employees and then rewarding himself with a multimillion dollar
bonus for having saved the company so much money. Greed is what the economic
system being constructed by the corporate libertarians encourages and rewards. 
</P>
<P>
Smith had a strong dislike for <I>both</I> governments and corporations. He
viewed government primarily as instruments for extracting taxes to subsidize
elites and for intervening in the market to protect monopoly. In his words, "Civil
government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in
reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who
have some property against those who have none at all." Smith made no
mention of government intervention to set and enforce minimum social, health,
worker safety, and environmental standards in the common interest&#151;to protect the
poor against the rich. We can imagine that given the experience of his day the
possibility never occurred to him.  
</P>
<P>
The theory of market economics, as contrasted to free market ideology, specifies
a number of basic conditions needed for a market to set prices efficiently in
the public interest. The greater the violation of these conditions, the less
efficient the market system. Most basic is the condition that markets must be
competitive. I recall the professor in my elementary economics course using the
example of a market comprised of small wheat farmers selling to small grain
millers to illustrate the idea of perfect market competition. Today, four
companies&#151;Conagra, ADM Milling, Cargill, and Pillsbury&#151;mill nearly 60 percent of
all flour produced in the United States, and two of them&#151;Conagra and
Cargill&#151;control 50 percent of grain exports.  
</P>
<P>
In the real world of unregulated markets, successful players get larger and in
many instances use the resulting economic power to drive or buy out weaker
players to gain control of ever larger shares of the market. In other instances
"competitors" collude  through cartels or strategic alliances to
increase profits by setting market prices above the level of optimal efficiency.
The larger individual and more collusive market players become, the more
difficult it is for newcomers and small independent firms to survive, the more
monopolistic and less competitive the market becomes, and the more political
power the biggest firms wield behind demands for concessions from governments
that allow them to externalize ever more of their costs to the community.  
</P>
<P>
Given this reality, one might expect the economic rationalists to be outspoken
in arguing for the need to restrict mergers and acquisitions and break up
monopolistic firms to restore the conditions of a competitive market. More often
they argue exactly the opposite position&#151;that to "compete" in today's
global markets firms must merge into ever larger combinations. In other words,
they espouse a theory that assumes small firms and advocate policies that
strengthen monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
Another basic condition of efficient market allocation is that the full costs of
production must be born by the producer and be included in the producer's
selling price. Economists call it cost internalization. This condition is so
basic to market theory that it is rarely disputed even by the most doctrinaire
of free market ideologues. If some portion of the cost of producing a product
are borne by third parties who in no way participate in or benefit from the
transaction, then economists say the costs have been externalized and the price
of the product is distorted accordingly. Another way of putting it is that every
externalized cost involves privatizing a gain and socializing its associated
costs onto the community.  
</P>
<P>
Externalized costs don't go away&#151;they are simply ignored by those who benefit
from making the decisions that result in others incurring them. For example,
when a forest products corporation obtains rights to clear-cut Forest Service
land at give away prices and leaves behind a devastated habitat, the company
reaps the immediate profit and the society bears the long term cost. When
logging companies are contracted by the Mitsubishi Corporation to cut the
forests of the Penan tribes people of Sarawak the corporation bears no cost for
devastating native culture and ways of life.  
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Dow Chemical externalizes production costs when it dumps wastes
without adequate treatment, thus passing the resulting costs of air, water and
soil pollution onto the community in the form of additional health costs,
discomfort, lost working days, a need to buy bottled water, and the cost of
cleaning up what has been contaminated. Walmart externalizes costs when it buys
from Chinese contractors who pay their workers too little to maintain their
basic physical and mental health or fail to maintain adequate worker safety
standards and then dismiss without compensation those workers who are injured.
</P>
<P>
When the seller retains the benefit of the externalized cost, this represents an
unearned profit&#151;an important source of market inefficiency. Passing the benefit
to the buyer in the form of a lower price creates still another source of
inefficiency by encouraging forms of consumption that use finite resources
inefficiently. For example, the more the environmental and social costs of
producing and driving an automobile are externalized, the more automobiles
people buy and the more they drive them. Urban sprawl increases, more of our
productive lands are paved over, more pollutants are released, petroleum
reserves are depleted more rapidly, and voters favor highway construction over
public transportation, sidewalks, and bicycle paths. 
</P>
<P>
Yet rather than demanding that costs be fully internalized, the corporate
libertarians are active advocates of eliminating government regulation, pointing
to potential cost savings for consumers and ignoring the social and
environmental consequences. Similarly they advise localities in need of
employment that they must become more internationally competitive in attracting
investors by offering them more favorable conditions, i.e., more opportunities
to externalize their costs through various subsidies, low cost labor, lax
environmental regulations, and tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
Market forces create substantial pressure on business to decrease costs and
increase profits by increasing efficiency. The corporate rationalists fail to
mention that one way firms increase their "efficiency" is to
externalize more of their costs. The more powerful the firm, the greater its
ability to take this course. As ecological economist Neva Goodwin has observed,
"...power is largely what externalities are about. What's the point of
having power, if you can't use it to externalize your costs&#151;to make them fall on
someone else?" When corporate libertarians promote practices that allow
corporations and wealthy investors to socialize their costs and privatize their
gains, they reveal their fidelity to a political interest rather than to
economic principles.
</P>
<P>
A third condition basic to the market theories of Adam Smith, but rarely noted
by corporate libertarians&#151;is that capital is locally or nationally rooted and
its owners are directly involved in its management. Adam Smith made quite
explicit in <I>The Wealth of Nations</I> his assumption that capital would be
rooted in place in the locality where its owner lived. He made it clear that
this condition is critical to enabling the invisible hand of the market to
translate the pursuit of self-interest into optimal public benefit. Indeed, the
following is the only sentence in the entire text in he made reference to the
invisible hand.  
</P>
<P><blockquote>
By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends
only his own security, and by directing that industry in such a manner as its
produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in
this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which
was no part of his intention.</blockquote>
</P>
<P>
The circumstance that Adam Smith believed induced the individual to invest
locally, was the inability to supervise his capital when employed far from his
home. In the current age of instant communications by phone, fax, and computer,
and twenty-four hour air travel to anywhere in the world that circumstance no
longer endures. However, the advantage to the community and the larger society
of productive investment being locally owned remains. Local investment is more
likely to remain in place and is more easily held to local standards, 
</P>
<P>
Smith was also quite explicit that optimal market efficiency depends on the
owners of capital being directly involved in its management&#151;the owner managed
enterprise. One could also argue that implicitly he favored worker owned
enterprises, as in his ideal small firm owner, manager, and worker were one and
the same person. 
</P>
<P>
Thus Smith's vision of an efficient market was one comprised of small,
owner-managed enterprises located in the communities in which the owners reside,
share in the community's values, and have a personal stake in its future. It is
a market that bears little in common with a globalized economy dominated by
massive corporations without local or national allegiance managed by transient
professionals who are removed from real owners by layers of investment
institutions and holding companies. 
</P>
<P>
Economist Neva Goodwin, who heads the Global Development and Environment
Institute at Tufts University suggests that the neoclassical school of
economics, with which many of most vocal proponents of corporate libertarianism
are identified, may be roughly characterized as the political economy of Adam
Smith minus the political analysis of Karl Marx. 
</P>
<P>
The classical political economy of Adam Smith was a much broader, more humane
subject than the economics that is taught in universities today. . . . For at
least a century it has been virtually taboo to talk about economic power in the
capitalist context; that was a communist (Marxist) idea. The concept of class
was similarly banned from discussion.   
</P>
<P>
Adam Smith was as acutely aware of issues of power and class as he was of the
dynamics of competitive markets. However, the neoclassical economists and the
neomarxist economists bifurcated his holistic perspective on the political
economy, one taking those portions of the analysis that favored the owners of
property and the other those that favored those who sell their labor. Thus, the
neoclassical economists left out Smith's considerations of the destructive role
of power and class. And the neomarxists left out the beneficial functions of the
market. Both advanced social experiments embodying a partial vision of society
on a massive scale and with disastrous consequence.  

<p><br>
<h2>In Praise of Competitive Markets</h2>

When the necessary conditions are met the market is a powerful and efficient
mechanisms for allocating resources. What we now have is not a market economy.
It is increasingly a command economy centrally planned and managed by the
world's largest corporations to maximize financial returns to top managers and
the wealthiest shareholders at the expense of the rest of society. If the
corporate libertarians were to bear serious allegiance to market principles and
human rights, they would be calling for policies aimed at achieving the
conditions in which markets function in a democratic fashion in the public
interest. They would be calling for measures to end subsidies and preferential
treatment for large corporations, to break up corporate monopolies, encourage
the distribution of property ownership, internalize social and environmental
costs, root capital in place, secure the rights of workers to the just fruits of
their labor, and limit opportunities to obtain extravagant individual incomes
far greater than their productive contribution.  
</P>
<P>
Corporate libertarianism is not about creating the market conditions that market
theory argues will result in optimizing the public interest. It is not about the
public interest at all. It is about defending and institutionalizing the right
of the economically powerful to do best serves their immediate interests without
public accountability for the consequences. It places power in institutions that
