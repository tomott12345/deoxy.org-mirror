<p>

The term "Neurospace" I learned from the Kiev artist Vladimir
Muzehesky, through Geert Lovink. What I immediately thought he meant
by it was a comparison of that space which is posited as belonging to
the computer with the neural space or the inner-body experience, that
comes, for most of us, largely through psychedelic drugs&#151;neurospace as
the space of hallucinations, for example. I would like to compare and
contrast, as they used to say in school, cyberspace and neurospace.
There are similarities and differences.
<p>
    I remember some years ago, when virtual reality suddenly appeared
with a big whizbang on the scene, going to a conference in New York
where <a href="leary.htm">Timothy Leary</a>, God bless him, appeared with Jaron Lanier and
couple of other cybernauts. Tim was wearing the goggles, he was on
stage and he said, "Oooh, I have been here before." So right from the
start there was this connection set up between virtual reality and the
LSD experience&#151;or as some us prefer to call it "the entheogenic
experience," which is just a fancy way of not using the word
psychedelic because it alerts the police. Actually, "<a href="def/entheogn.htm">entheogenic</a>" means the birth of the "Divine Within." I am able to use this term that is
meaningful for me even though I am not a theist in the strict sense of
the word. I don't think you have to believe in God to understand that
there can be an experience of the Divine Becoming Within.
<p>
    In fact historically&#151;and, at least for me, experientially and
existentially&#151;that has been the most important aspect of the
reappearance of psychedelic drugs in my lifetime. I am almost an exact
contemporary of LSD: I was born in 1945, and Albert Hofmann was already
cooking up various preliminary versions. Last summer I got to meet
Hofmann, and he is a wonderful advertisement for the psychedelic
experience. He is well over 80, and he is hale and hearty&#151;got all his
brain cells and is still working, eats like a horse, drinks like a
fish. This is my lifetime we are talking about.
<p>
    There is a historical question, in the history of religions per se,
and that is: Where do psychedelics come from? <a href="mckenna.htm">Terence McKenna</a> believes that human consciousness itself is a function of the psychedelic
experience, specifically of the psilocybin mushroom. He believes that
one day an ape took a shroom and became a human, because cognition
appeared. Terence says that what makes us human is the psychedelic
experience. I don't know if I literally believe this; in any case, I
don't believe in any single origin for human consciousness. But it's
enlightening to think about the possibility that we may owe our
difference from the other members of the simian clan to our ability to
experience psychedelics in a certain way. If that were the case, it
would be true that our entire experience of cognition&#151;which
historically belongs in the category of what is known as
"religion"&#151;would have begun with psychedelics. The entire psychedelic
experience would be co-existent in time with human becoming. An
interesting hypothesis; we can add it to all theories of human origins.
<p>
    I like to think of palimpsests. In the Middle Ages they didn't have
much paper, so they would write one way on the paper and then would
write another way on the same paper. Sometimes they would even write a
third way. They were used to reading it this way. My approach to theory
is a palimpsestic one: I like to pile up theories one on top of another
and hold up the whole stack up to the light and see if still any light
is coming through. Think of it as animation gels, but with writing in a
stack. Add all those theories, one on top of each other.
<p>
    The positive way of looking at consciousness is that is "us." The
bad aspect of it is that consciousness itself would seem to be a
separation process. Georges Bataille spoke about this in an interesting
way: he hypothesized that all religion concerns a memory trace of a
time in which the human was separate from nature&#151;from the animal,
let's say. And if you believe in evolution, this is just literally
true. There was a time when we were apes of some sort. It's at the
moment of consciousness that this separation occurs. Suddenly it's no
longer a question of the animal experience and what Bataille calls the
"original intimacy." We are now taken out of the matrix and plunged
into cognition. Religion in this view begins immediately after this
moment, because <i>religio</i> means to relink, to link up again. What we're
trying to do with all these religious and philosophical forms is to try
to link up with the original intimacy, which we lost when we began to
experience cognition.
<p>
    If Terence is right, then cognition begins with drugs, and then the
next step would be to take more drugs to try to recover what one had
lost. So, in this reading, human consciousness and human religion,
which are so closely related, would have always been involved with
psychedelic plants. Here we come up against a problem in anthropology,
which I have only recently become aware of. As anthropologists look at
the most "primitive" societies that we can find&#151;that is to say hunter-
gatherer tribal societies&#151;these societies don't seem to have much to
do with psychedelics. According to anthropologists, psychedelic plants
occur in human history with agriculture&#151;so, at the very most, 12000
years ago.
<p>
    Agriculture, the age we are still in, is at most 1% of the whole
human story. But if you go to South America and compare the hunting
tribes and the primitive agriculturalists, who grow a bit of
subsistence vegetables, do some hunting and fishing&#151;without strong
leadership, very egalitarian&#151;it is in these groups that we begin to
see the psychedelic plants emerge as a cultural phenomena. It
immediately struck me that there is something wrong here. Why should
agriculturalists know more about wild plants than the hunters and
gatherers, who in fact depend on the wild plants? They depend at least
70% on gathering, and only 30% on hunting. The gathering, which is
usually done by women, is much more important economically than the
hunting, which is usually done by men. The men think that hunting is
much more prestigious, but it is economically less important. The
hunters of course know about all the plants, but they have not
necessarily ritualized it yet: they have not made a cult of the
psychedelic plant.
<p>
   Agriculture is the only radical new technology that ever appeared in
the world; what it amounts to is a cutting into the earth. If you read
any anthropology about Native Americans, you will find that when the
white Europeans arrived and tried to force the tribes into
agriculture, the tribal people always say the same thing: "What, you
want us to rape our Mother, the Earth? This is perverse. How could you
ask human beings to do this?" Agriculture immediately appears as a bad
deal to these tribes. There is no doubt that this technology leads
inevitably and fairly quickly to social hierarchies, separation, class
structure, property, and religion as we understand it&#151;a priest class
that tells everybody else what to do and how to think. It leads, in
other words, to authoritarianism and, ultimately, to the state itself.
<p>
    <a href="failure.htm">Economy, money, all the misery of civilization, we owe to
agriculture.</a> Before that, you have two million years of hunting and
gathering, the beautiful cave art, a world that looks suspiciously
utopian, a golden age by comparison with a lot of the problems that
agriculture brings about. In some sense, agriculture is fall from
grace. I don't want to be a reactionary, a luddite&#151;I am just simply
pointing out something that is very true and obvious, but it took a
long time for civilized human beings to realize this. In the 1960s, the
anthropologist Marshal Sahlins discovered that the hunting and
gathering societies that exist today only work an average of four
hours a day to get their food, whereas the agricultural societies work
an average of sixteen hours a day. Hunter-gatherers have over 200 kinds
of food in their larder over the course of a year, whereas the
primitive agriculturalists will only eat an average of twenty.
<p> 
From this point of view, Sahlins pointed out, it is absolutely
incomprehensible that anybody would ever give up hunting for
agriculture. Ever since I read that book <i>Stone Age Economy</i> I have
been figuring out why&#151;why did we give up this Garden of Eden kind of
situation? Of course the hunter knows starvation, but the hunter
doesn't know scarcity; that only comes into being with economy. The
hunter's life can be miserable&#151;it can be too cold, too hot, too
naked, he can be wiped out by the polar bear, whatever&#151;but the one
thing the hunter does not have anything of is the miseries of
civilization.
<p>
    If we are going to talk about the positive features of
civilization, <a href="korten_index.htm">let's remember that they are only serviceable for 10% of
any given population,</a> in other words, the property-owning elite. For
everybody else, civilization is a fucking awful deal. It turns you into
a serf or a slave, into the human sacrifice. We know that cannibalism
belongs to agriculture, not to the hunting tribes. I like bread&#151;I'm
not about to give up bread. What I am trying to point out to you with
this exaggerated attack on agriculture, is that agriculture is a very
severe technological break. It is as if you drew a line: on that side
there is wild forest, and on this side there is culture, humanity and,
ultimately, civilization. On the clear side, we cut into the earth, we
make straight lines, we know the technology of seeds. The calendar is
the first ideology, in the sense of false consciousness, because only
farmers could invent it. Industry is a minor epiphenomenon of
agriculture, from this point of view. Agriculture is the one and only
important technology that has ever been invented and that calls for a
complete reevaluation of the human relation vis-a-vis the natural
world, the world of plants and animals.
<p>
    As a result of this entire new relationship, of this novelty, there
will be an entirely new interpretation of the psychedelic plant. The
entheogenic, magic plant will now emerge in a religious
context&#151;whereas before it might only have been a question of the
individual knowledge of an individual gatherer. Now, suddenly, there
has to be a cult of the entheogenic plant. Because agriculture is so
traumatic for human society, it necessitates having a living, <a href="shaman.htm">shamanic</a>,
magical relationship with plants. Before, plants were like other
beings, now they are strange spirits that grow in the forest. Actually,
one anthropologist wrote a fascinating book on tobacco as a psychedelic
plant in South America: the very first agriculture would have been the
growing of psychoactive plants, and that's why human beings might even
become farmers, to ensure a nice supply of tobacco or mushrooms or
whatever. A friend of mine once said, "Yeah, everything is
psychotropic." Any substance that you can take into your body will
bring about a transmutation. I don't care if it's water, food,
air&#151;it's all transformation through substance.
<p>
    It is not true that agriculture discovered psychedelics. I can
prove, on the basis of mythology, that hunting society knew it very
well. All myths concerning psychedelic plants always say that we
learned about the plants from the wild people from the forest. One
example: the Buiti-cult from northwestern Africa, which is based on
ibogaine. They claim that they got it from the pygmies. Suddenly we
seem to see for the first time the appearance of the psychotropic
plant, whereas before it was simply one among many psychoactive things
in a world that was entirely psychoactive, it's now the one special
substance that will allow us to recover that original intimacy. It will
make us better than conscious, it will give us a beyond mere
consciousness, which in a sense will be a return to that original
intimacy of nature.
<p>
    It's fairly clear that all the great neolithic societies had some
kind of cult of soma&#151;the Sanskrit word for the psychoactive
experience. The Rg-Veda, one of the oldest books of humanity, is all
about the psychedelic experience. If only Tim Leary had used the
Rg-Veda instead of the Tibetan Book of the Death to introduce LSD, the
sixties would have been a different decade. The Tibetan Book is about
death, a downer, whereas the Rg-Veda is very much about life and joy
and power. Anyway, all neolithic and classical societies had some
variety of this. We owe these discoveries to the great <a href="bmushrmd.htm">Gordon Wasson</a>, who was the first to discuss whether the soma of the Rg-Veda was in
fact a magic mushroom. He also came to the conclusion that the
<a href="def/em.htm">Eleusinian mysteries</a>, one of the central religious rights of the
ancient Greeks, was also fueled by a psychoactive plant. The ancient
Persians had something called "helma," it might have been a plant that
contains harmoline. I claim to have discovered that the ancient Irish
had a similar cult... and of course we know about the Aztecs and the
Mayans: they still had an active psychedelic cult when the conquistadors
arrived. In some of the old Spanish chronicles you can actually read
about magic mushrooms. But somehow these texts were lost, or no one
read them, or if they read them they did not believe them, or they were
horrified by them.
<p>
    It is the spread of Christianity which seems to signal the end of
the classical psychedelic world. John Allegro, one of the original
Death Sea Scroll scholars&#151;he went crazy, according to most
people&#151;wrote a book called <i>The Mushroom and the Cross</i> in which he
said that Jesus Christ was a mushroom. I always felt that Jesus Christ
can be whatever you want him to be, so why not? Historically, perhaps
this antipsychedelic effect had something to do with wine, the
sacrament of Christianity. Wine itself, although it is psychoactive, is
not nearly as psychedelic as magic mushrooms. And alcohol has it's
problems. Terence McKenna has taken a very puritanical stand&#151;anti-alcohol, 
coffee, sugar, tea, any of those modern psychotropics.
<p>
    The West probably lost awareness of the most mind-altering
substances in a gradual process parallel to the diffusion of
Christianity. Wine is sacramentalized, and its Dionysian potential
remains, as magic&#151;for example in the Catholic Mass, a magical
performance in which bread and wine are turned into a cannibal feast,
and in the "soma function," which means that everything is
psychotropics. As one of the Sufi poets said: "A drunkard will never
become wise, even after a hundred bottles of wine, but a wise man will
become intoxicated with one glass of water."
<p>
    Think about Rabelais, for example. He devoted the last chapter of
his book to what he called the "Herb Pantagruelion" and it's clear to
any modern reader that he is talking here about marijuana. So the
psychedelic knowledge was not even lost, not even by the time of
Rabelais. It was handed down on a nonliterate level&#151;by wise women,
country doctors, witch doctors, and peasant mothers who knew about
plants. The knowledge has become occult, it's a secret. Rabelais is
playing with the fact that he is knowing something that you don't know.
The knowledge was never lost because no culture can persist without an
some opening towards non-ordinary consciousness. You have to have some
escape valve to civilization, even if it is mass psychosis. There
has got to be a way out.
<p>
    The idea of the transformation through ingestion of entheogens or
psychedelic plants still was not quite erased even in the High Middle
Ages. The knowledge has been condemned to hell. The psilocybin mushroom
was always here, it never went away, but it was hiding&#151;I am talking
like Terence now, let's just take it as a metaphor&#151;it was hiding
because nobody respected it, nobody needed it. It was not because
Wasson brought the spores out on his boots in 1956 that suddenly magic
mushrooms were all over the world again; it was because some paradigm
shift occurred at the same time. If Wasson hadn't done it, someone else
would have made the discovery. As <a href="raw.htm">Robert Anton Wilson</a> says "When it is steam engine time, it's steam engines."
<p>
   The rediscovery had already been going on since the nineteenth
century when people like Baudelaire, Rimbaud, and DeQuincy, or the
Romantics, who got into hashish and opium. They learned about it from
the Islamic world. Once again, in a very occult and hidden way, these
were <i>poetes maudites</i>&#151;damned knowledge, known by damned people. Then
there is Antonin Artaud, who went to Mexico and took peyote; or Ernst
Juenger, Mircea Eliade, C.G. Jung, Walter Benjamin, Ernst Bloch&#151;they
were all experimenting with drugs. We know about Aldous Huxley because
he wrote the first book in English. So when the psychedelic revolution
happens, it is already an old story.
<p>
   The invention of LSD, around 1945-47, is somehow emblematic to me.
It is, in fact, the very first synthetic psychedelic drug; and the
remarkable thing about it is that you need 200mg or even less. That's
nothing. It takes the whole story of the psychedelic experience into a
new, much more technical world of modern science. Before, it is the
primitive world of the plants. There is a reason for this. In the
beginning, I have hypothesized, drugs first appear in human history
because they are used in a religious way in agricultural societies, and
the use and discovery of psychedelics is somehow a response to a
technological development. This technological advance makes more
poignant, more violent our separation from that original intimacy, from
that experience of pure animal consciousness. So that is it technology
itself that causes the recognition, on the part of early agricultural
societies, of the cultic and religious aspect of these plants. Now we
are here, a good deal later in human history&#151;and there is the first
interesting development in technology since agriculture.
<p>
    It could be that, around 1945, we see things...instead of becoming
more and more massive&#151;suddenly become more dematerialized. (The atomic
bomb dematerializes matter in a very radical way.) A very spiritual
experience, on the one hand, and the computer, on the other
hand&#151;which, as we know now, was destined to bring about the
"information economy." You cannot eat information, so it isn't really
an economy, and it never will be&#151;but there is nevertheless something
to this expression. There is a truth behind the bullshit, there is this
dematerialization, a revulsion against the heaviness of the body, a
disembodiment of production. We know that computers are supposed to be
a great spiritual event, even though it is still a machine; it is not a
heavy machine, a simple machine, an on-off switch.
<p>
    Of course, we will not overcome the economy of production through
this. Someone still has to make shoes, has to grow food&#151;and it is not
going to be us! <i>We</i> aren't going to get our hands dirty with that
anymore. Let the Mexicans do it, while we will inhabit this marvelous
gnostic space of pure information. We have sent our filthy polluting
factories to India, to Bophal, to Chernobyl, so that we can be clean,
so we can be the "cyber class." No matter what you think about the
liberatory potentials of the computer, we must also face up to this
fact that there is a disembodiment going on. Suddenly you ain't got no
body anymore&#151;it's analogous to the disembodiment that the atomic bomb
brings about when it hits you. Is it a coincidence therefore, that in
this precise same two years, LSD is synthesized, mescaline, MDMA, plus
the rediscovery of the mushroom... There is a very interesting link
between technology and the psychedelic experience.
<p>
    Probably the occultation of psychedelics climaxes with
industrialization and with the sneaking substitution of machinic space
for organic space as a principle of psychic ordering. Even agricultural
consciousness is still organic consciousness: it has to do with the
earth, with plants and animals. It is a very ordered, gridwork
consciousness, but it still is organic. But as we get toward the
"Satanic mills" (Blake) and the English working class of Engels,
machinic space has become the ordering principle. It is not the plow
that creates space anymore, it is the production line that creates
psychic space. So Victorian puritanism and imperialism must represent
the public repression of the unconscious by a rigid sobriety based on a
mind/machine model that is the isolate and commanding cogito. If you
wanted to find one period of human history when there really was a
complete amnesia about the psychedelic experience, it would be the
nineteenth century, around 1830-1880, when us civilized folks not only
forgot that there was something like the psychedelic experience but
denied it.
<p>
    As a culture, we like to laugh at primitive tribes&#151;for example,
those who are shown photographs of themselves and cannot recognize
them. But in 1876 a French scientist fell by accident into one of the
paleolithic caves. Later, in his diary he wrote that there seemed to be
some scribbles on the wall. He could not see that it was art, he was
just as blind as the pygmy who is blind to the photograph. Suddenly, a
few years later, people could see it as art. What allowed T. S. Eliot
to say that ever since Lascaux, Western art "tumbled from the
staircase"? What allowed Picasso suddenly to see African masks, the
French expressionists to see Japanese art, the hippies in the sixties
to hear Indian music? For the colonialist British who visited India,
the music for them was like the "whining of the mosquitoes&#151;how can
they stand it?" The Brits could not hear it as music. My parents'
generation could never hear Indian music as music: "What's that buzzing
noise? Are you kids stoned again?" That is what I call a paradigm shift
of cognition.
<p>
    At the very moment when entheogenesis&#151;that is, the birth of the
Divine Within&#151;reappears in the West with the late Romantics as a
subculture, as "occult history," the conditions were being set up for
this paradigm shift. We are still basically undergoing it. The only
thing that could even pretend to suppress this shift of consciousness,
would be the Law, as in the War on Drugs. But our law is a machine law,
a gridwork, clockwork law, and it is obviously unable to contain the
fluidity of the organic. That is why the War on Drugs will never ever
work. You might as well declare war on every plant. So public discourse
is approaching breakdown over the question of consciousness. The War on
Drugs is a war on cognition itself, about thought itself as the human
condition. Is thought this dualist cartesian reason? Or is cognition
this mysterious, complex, organic, magical thing with little mushrooms
elves dancing around. Which it is to be?
<p>
    <a href="pdfa/index.htm">The War on Drugs</a> is a paradigm war. Each refinement in machinic consciousness will evoke a dialectical response from the organic realm.
It is as if the mushroom elves were there; it is as if there were plant
consciousness that responds to the machinic consciousness. It is such a
beautiful metaphor&#151;you don't have to believe in the elves, it's all
human consciousness, ultimately. You don't have to believe in something
supernatural to explain this. So around the mid-twentieth century,
technology begins to shift away from an imperial-gigantic frame to a
more "inward" dimension, with the splitting of the atom, the virtual
space of communications and the computer. And it was around that same
time that the really serious psychedelics begin to show up&#151;mescaline,
psilocybin, LSD, <a href="dmt.htm">DMT</a>, ketamine, MDMA, etc. etc.
<p>
    The paradigm war that's now breaking out is one measure of an
antagonism between cyberspace and neurospace, but the relation cannot
simply be vulgarized as a dichotomy. This brings us up to the so-called
"second psychedelic revolution"&#151;just another battle in the same war.
From one point of view, we lost the War on Drugs in the sixties, it was
crushed and driven underground again. What Leary and Huxley dreamed of,
a transformation of society through this experience, did not occur. Or
did it? Now we know that the CIA was deeply involved in spreading LSD
around the world. On Wasson's second trip to Mexico there was a CIA-agent 
in the group. They all had a wonderful time, except one
person&#151;guess who... They were interested in the bad-trip side of
things&#151;certainly also a psychedelic experience. The CIA attempted to
monopolize LSD, to control its distribution, they funded virtually
every research project. They were interested in brainwashing. The
sixties owe just as much to the CIA as they do to the Learies and the
hippies. There was this complex web of good and evil, smart and stupid,
all in mix of smoke&#151;fractal patterns influencing each other, in which
every jewel reflects every other jewel. That is the secret history of
the sixties.
<p>
    Through the seventies and eighties things looked fairly grim. The
"second psychedelic revolution" we now have involves some new drugs
like ibogaine and a new, more careful scientific approach. We have all
learned to be careful where the funding comes from and in the
protocols. And there is a new generation: don't worry, the kids are
alright. LSD is a dangerous drug, it destroys some people, but life is
a risky business. If there's one thing I hate, it's the word "safety".
We live in a civilization of safety, in which we are eventually
cocooned from all danger, that is to say, from all experience. What we
are left with is a vegetable plugged into a computer, who never leaves
the room, like a hideous vision of a William Gibson novel. We would be
well advised to rediscover risk.
<p>
    The new round of psychedelic work one can find in the work of the
Albert Hofmann Foundation and in the spread of acid in Eastern
Europe&#151;all part of this "second psychedelic revolution," which I very
much link up to the Internet, this dialectic response between the plant
world and the machine world. The antagonism between cyberspace and
neurospace is one thing&#151;but there is also an analogy. Somehow,
cyberspace is hallucinogenic, or it was thought to be. They both
involve a visionary inner space. It is like saying that LSD is like the
atomic bomb, "it blew your mind." It has this negative side to it as
well.
<p>
    Let us be clear: cyberspace is happening outside your body, you
might move your body, seeing these bad animations moving around you.
Did virtual reality fail already? 
<p>

Somebody said today that virtual reality failed because it was 
already virtually experienced through the
media. Save your money and hear about it on television&#151;that's enough.
It is very conceptual, one of those futures that never happened and
never will. And don't forget that cyberspace is much more than only VR.
The really important Net is not the Internet, but the international
banking network. There, one trillion dollars is being moved around each
day. "Money went to heaven," as my friend Gordon uses to say. Money
that refers to money that refers to money, etc.&#151;the most abstract
concept humanity has ever developed. Compared to this the Internet is
nothing, it is a tiny corner of electrocommunications.
<p>
    Nevertheless, the Internet is interesting to me because it seems to
have a liberatory potential&#151;we want to find out it's psychedelic
aspect. I personally am getting more and more pessimistic, the
trajectories all seem to end in a reduction of our autonomy. The
Internet is either going to be another crisis-solving device for global
capitalism, or it will vanish or be relegated to a minor communications
medium, a good deal less important than the post office. The are only a
very few corners left for beautiful agitation. We can no longer expect
to win this particular battle of the paradigm war. I don't think that
this technology, any more than any other technology, is going to be the
fix that will bring us freedom and glory. It is not the solution; it
isn't even the question anymore, much less the answer. I would prefer
to see the question enlarged to include neurospace&#151;because
cyberspace, conceptually, is a form of disembodiment.
<p>
    As a historian of religions, I see that the tragedy of the human
story is the separation of mind and body. Since Mesopotamian times,
religion has always been an attempt to escape the body: it becomes more
and more gnostic, in the sense of hatred of the body. If you want to
hear some marvelous gnostic, all you have to do is to listen to some of
the enthusiastic advocates of the Internet. The people who really
believe that you are going to transcend the body, download
consciousness, escape from the corpse. It is immortality through
technology, transcendence through machinic consciousness. It is the
same of pie in the sky when you die that the old anarchists used to
criticize about religion. The Internet, in this aspect, is simply the
modern version of religion. Cyberspace is our version of heaven.
<p> 
These myths do not go away. This rationalism turns out to be another
irrational cult, just another ideology, another form for class
consciousness. The problem of reembodiment, therefore, is the only
religious, intellectual, and technical question we need to ask
ourselves. The body is both the mystery and the key to the mystery at
the same time. Cyberspace doesn't happen in the body. The "Body
without Organs" is a phrase from Deleuze and Guattari&#151;and they are
strangely ambivalent about the moral aspect of this body. I understand
their "machinic consciousness," that it is not necessarily evil. I
could talk about the psychedelic experience as an imaginal machine. My
quarrel with machinic consciousness comes when it posits that the body
is evil and that the mind is good. And do not forget that the Catholic
Church loved Descartes. This Cartesian consciousness we now think of as
machinic, modern, and scientific, was at one time hailed by the
Catholic Church as a true religious philosophy.
<p>
    Neurospace also involves hallucinations. You think you are in the
Palace of Memory, but you aren't. You're just sitting in your room,
stoned on acid: you're in an imaginal space, just as with cyberspace.
And yet, where is this event taking place&#151;but in the body? Neurospace
is a space of embodiment. Cyberspace is a space of disembodiment. I
don't want to sound like a moralist... We can add terms like
"complexity," "chaos," or "the karmic web of jewels."
<p>
    The latest developments in machine consciousness have a "Deleuze-
Guattarian" aspect of subversion, as with the Internet&#151;activism&#151;with
a certain psychedelic flavor. While "drugs" are produced out of a
"second nature" that is nothing if not machinic. The whole "drug
crisis" is very much a crisis of machinic consciousness&#151;and heroin and
cocaine are very much machine products, just like LSD. However, an
oppositional aspect also appears, a "second psychedelic revolution", a
dialectic of re-embodiment ("neurospace") as opposed to the tendency
toward false transcendence &amp; disembodiment in "cyberspace."
<p>
    One of the great "rediscoveries" of this new entheogenesis is the
dialectical nature of <a href="ayadef.htm">ayahuasca</a> or yage&#151;that is, that organic DMT can
be "realized" in combination with an MAO-inhibitor like harmine, and
that plant sources for these two substances are globally diffused,
widespread to the point of ubiquity, impossible to control, and free.
Preparations require only low kitchen tech. Neo-ayahuasca, unlike
computer technology, is not a part of capitalism or any other
ideological control system.
<p>
    Is it fair to make this comparison? Yes, to the extent that
entheogenesis and cybertech are both concerned with information and
therefore with epistemology. In fact, we could call both of them
"gnostic systems"&#151;both are implicated in the goal of knowing that
emerges from the gulf that seems to separate mind/soul/spirit from
body. So the entheogenic version of this knowing, however, implies
enlarging the definition of the body to include neurospace, while the
cybernetic version implies the disappearance of the body into
information, the "downloading of the consciousness." These are perhaps
both absurd extremes, images rather than political situations; they are
also potent myths, powerful images.
<p>
    We need a politique here&#151;not an ideology but an active cognizance
of actually persisting situations, as clearly as we can grasp them in
our modeled, stoned condition. We need a strategic sense of where to
apply the nudges of our material art, the little martial, Zen moves,
whereby even a weak person can win a battle. Whereby even we, despised
marginals, could actually have self-empowerment and thereby influence
on history. All of this leads to a vision of amusingly apocalyptic
nonsensical self-importance, like "Neuro-hackers vs the New World
Order" Well, it's at least a nice idea for a science-fiction novel.
