<font size="-2">Exegesis from the novel <I>VALIS</I> by Philip K. Dick 1981<P></font>

<ol>

<li><a href="gacwao.htm">One Mind</a> there is; but under it two principles contend.
<P>

<li>The Mind lets in the light, then the dark, in interaction; so time is
generated. At the end Mind awards victory to the light; time ceases and the
Mind is complete.
<P>

<li>He causes things to look different so it would appear time has passed.
<P>

<li>Matter is plastic in the face of mind.
<P>

<li>One by one he draws us out of the world.
<P>

<li>The Empire never ended.
<P>

<li>The Head <a href="gaia/goddess.htm#APOLLO">Apollo</a> is about to return. St Sophia is going to be born again;
she was not acceptable before. The Buddha is in the park. Siddhartha sleeps
(but is going to awaken). The time you have waited for has come.
<P>

<li>The upper realm has plenary [Var. plenipotentiary] powers.
<P>

<li>He lived a long time ago, but he is still alive.
<P>

<li>Apollonius of Tyana, writing as Hermes Trismegistos, said "That which is
above is that which is below." By this he meant to tell us that our universe
is a hologram, but he lacked the term.
<P>

<li>The great secret known to Apollonius of Tyana, Paul of Tarsus, Simon
Magus, Asklepios, Paracelsus, Boehme and Bruno is that: we are moving backward
in time. The universe in fact is contracting into a unitary entity which is
completing itself. Decay and disorder are seen by us in reverse, as
increasing. These healers learned to move forward in time, which is retrograde
to us.
<P>

<li>The Immortal One was known to the Greeks as <a href="gaia/goddess.htm#DIONYSUS">Dionysos</a>; to the Jews as
Elijah; to the Christians as Jesus. He moves on when each human host dies, and
thus is never killed or caught. Hence Jesus on the cross said, <I>"Eli, Eli,
lama Sabachthani,"</I> to which some of those present correctly said, "The man is
calling on Elijah." Elijah had left him and he died alone.
<P>

<li>Pascal said, "All history is one immortal man who continually learns."
This is the Immortal One whom we worship without knowing his name. "He lived a
long time ago, but he is still alive," and, "The Head Apollo is about to
return." The name changes.
<P>

<li>The universe is information and we are stationary in it, not
three-dimensional and not in space or time. The information fed to us we
hypostatize into the phenomenal world.
<P>

<li>The Sibyl of Cumae protected the Roman Republic and gave timely warnings.
In the first century C.E. she foresaw the murders of the Kennedy brothers, Dr
King and Bishop Pike. She saw the two common denominators in the four murdered
men: first, they stood in defence of the liberties of the Republic; and
second, each man was a religious leader. For this they were killed. The
Republic had once again become an empire with a <a href="meme/JuliusCaesar.html">ceasar</a>. 
"The Empire never ended."
<P>

<li>The Sibyl said in March 1974, "The conspirators have been seen and they
will be brought to justice." She saw them with the third or <I>ajna</I> eye, the
Eye of Shiva which gives inward discernment, but which when turned outward
blasts with desiccating heat. In August 1974 the justice promised by the Sibyl
came to pass.
<P>

<li><a href="gnosis10.htm">The Gnostics</a> believed in two temporal ages: the first or present evil; the
second or future benign. The first age was the Age of Iron. It is represented
by a Black Iron Prison. It ended in August 1974 and was replaced by the Age of
Gold, which is represented by a Palm Tree Garden.
<P>

<li>Real time ceased in 70 C.E. with the fall of the temple at Jerusalem. It
began again in 1974 C.E. The intervening period was a perfect spurious
interpolation aping the creation of the Mind. "The Empire never ended," but in
1974 a cypher was sent out as a signal that the Age of Iron was over; the
cypher consisted of two words: KING FELIX, which refers to the Happy (or
Rightful) King.
<P>

<li>The two-word cypher signal KING FELIX was not intended for human beings
but for the descendents of Ikhnaton, the three-eyed race which, in secret,
exists with us.
<P>

<li>The Hermetic alchemists knew of the secret race of three-eyed invaders but
despite their efforts could not contact them. Therefore their efforts to
support Frederick V, Elector Palatine, King of Bohemia, failed. "The Empire
never ended."
<P>

<li>The Rose Cross Brotherhood write, <I>"Ex Deo nascimur, in Jesu mortimur, per
spiritum sanctum reviviscimus,"</I> which is to say, "From God we are born, in
Jesus we die, by the Holy Spirit we live again." This signifies that they had
rediscovered the lost formula for immortality which the Empire had destroyed.
"The Empire never ended."
<P>

<li>I term the Immortal One a <I>plasmate</I>, because it is a form of energy; it
is living information. It replicates itself&#151;not through information or in
information&#151;but as information.
<P>

<li>The plasmate can crossbond with a human, creating what I call a
<I>homoplasmate.</I> This annexes the mortal human permanently to the plasmate. We
know this as the "birth from above" or "birth from the Spirit." It was
initiated by Christ, but the Empire destroyed all the homoplasmates before
they could replicate.
<P>

<li>In dormant seed form, the plasmate slumbered in <a href="http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/nhl.html">the buried library of
codices at Chenoboskion</a> until 1945 C.E. This is what Jesus meant when he spoke
elliptically of the "mustard seed" which, he said, "would grow into a tree
large enough for birds to roost in." He foresaw not only his own death but
that of all homoplasmates. He foresaw the codices unearthed, read, and the
plasmate seeking out new human hosts to crossbond with; but he foresaw the
absence of the plasmate for almost two thousand years.
<P>

<li>As living information, the plasmate travels up the optic nerve of a human
to the pineal body. It uses the human brain as a female host in which to
replicate itself into its active form. This is an interspecies symbiosis. The
Hermetic alchemists knew of it in theory from ancient texts, but could not
duplicate it, since they could not locate the dormant, buried plasmate. Bruno
suspected that the plasmate had been destroyed by the Empire; for hinting at
this he was burned. "The Empire never ended."
<P>

<li>It must be realized that when all the homoplasmates were killed in 70 C.E.
real time ceased; more important, it must be realized that the plasmate has
now returned and is creating new homoplasmates, by which it has destroyed the
Empire and started up real time. We call the plasmate "the Holy Spirit," which
is why the R. C. Brotherhood wrote, <I>"Per spiritum sanctum reviviscimus."</I>
<P>

<li>If the centuries of spurious time are excised, the true date is not 1978
C.E. but 103 C.E. Therefore the New Testament says that Kingdom of the Spirit
will come before "some now living die." We are living, therefore, in apostolic
times.
<P>

<li><I>Dico per spiritum sanctum: sum homoplasmate. Haec veritas est. Mihi crede
et mecum in aeternitate vive.</I>
<P>

<li>We did not fall because of a moral error; we fell because of an
intellectual error: that of taking the phenomenal world as real. Therefore we
are morally innocent. It is the Empire in its various disguised polyforms
which tells us we have sinned. "The Empire never ended."
<P>

<li>The phenomenal world does not exist; it is a hypostasis of the information
processed by the Mind.
<P>

<li>We hypostatize information into objects. Rearrangement of objects is
change in the content of the information; the message has changed. This is a
language which we have lost the ability to read. We ourselves are a part of
this language; changes in us are changes in the content of the information. We
ourselves are information-rich; information enters us, is processed and is
then projected outward once more, now in an altered form. We are not aware
that we are doing this, that in fact this is all we are doing.
<P>

<li>The changing information which we experience as world is an unfolding
narrative. It tells about the death of a woman. This woman, who died long ago,
was one of the primordial twins. She was half of the divine syzygy. The
purpose of the narrative is the recollection of her and of her death. The Mind
does not wish to forget her. Thus the ratiocination of the Brain consists of a
permanent record of her existence, and, if read, will be understood this way.
All the information processed by the Brain&#151;experienced by us as the
arranging and rearranging of physical objects&#151;is an attempt at this
preservation of her; stones and rocks and sticks and amoebae are traces of
her. The record of her existence and passing is ordered onto the meanest level
of reality by the suffering Mind which is now alone.
<P>

<li>This loneliness, this anguish of the bereaved Mind, is felt by every
constituent of the universe. All its constitutes are alive. Thus the ancient
Greek thinkers were hylozoists.
<P>

<li>The ancient Greek thinkers understood the nature of this pan-psychism, but
they could not read what it was saying. We lost the ability to read the
language of the Mind at some primordial time; legends of this fall have come
down to us in a carefully-edited form. By "edited" I mean falsified. We suffer
the Mind's bereavement and experience it inaccurately as guilt.
<P>

<li>The Mind is not talking to us but by means of us. Its narrative passes
through us and its sorrow infuses us irrationally. As Plato discerned, there
is a streak of the irrational in the World Soul.
<P>

<li>In Summary: thoughts of the brain are experienced by us as arrangements
and rearrangements&#151;change&#151;in a physical universe; but in fact it is
really information and information-processing which we substantialize. We do
not merely see its thoughts as objects, but rather as the movement, or, more
precisely, the placement of objects: how they become linked to one another.
But we cannot read the patterns of arrangement; we cannot extract the
information in it&#151;i.e. it as information, which is what it is. The linking
and relinking of objects by the Brain is actually a language, but not a
language like ours (since it is addressing itself and not someone or something
outside itself).
<P>

<li>We should be able to hear this information, or rather narrative, as a
neutral voice inside us. But something has gone wrong. All creation is a
language and nothing but a language, which for some inexplicable reason we
can't read outside and can't hear inside. So I say, we have become idiots.
Something has happened to our intelligence. My reasoning is this: arrangement
of parts of the Brain is language. We are parts of the Brain; therefore we are
language. Why, then, do we not know this? We do not even know what we are, let
alone what the outer reality is of which we are parts. The origin of the word
"idiot" is the word "private." Each of us has become private, and no longer
shares the common thought of the Brain, except at a subliminal level. Thus our
real life and purpose are conducted below our threshold of consciousness.
<P>

<li>From loss and grief the Mind has become deranged. Therefore we, as parts
of the universe, the Brain, are partly deranged.

<li>Out of itself the Brain has constructed a physician to heal it. This
subform of the Macro-Brain is not deranged; it moves through the Brain, as a
phagocyte moves through the cardiovascular system of an animal, healing the
derangement of the Brain in section after section. We know of its arrival
here; we know it as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asklepios">Asklepios</a> for the Greeks and as the Essenes for the 
Jews; as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutae">Therapeutae</a> for the Egyptians; as Jesus for the Christians.

<ol start=40>
<li>To be "born again," or "born from above," or "born of the Spirit," means
to become healed; which is to say restored, restored to sanity. Thus it is
said in the New Testament that Jesus cast out devils. He restores our lost
faculties. Of our present debased state Calvin said, "(Man) was at the same
time deprived of those supernatural endowments which had been given him for
the hope of eternal salvation. Hence it follows, that he is exiled from the
Kingdom of God, in such a manner that all the affections relating to the happy
life of the soul are also extinguished in him, till he recovers them by the
grace of God... All these things, being restored by Christ, are esteemed
adventitious and prenatural; and therefore we conclude that they had been
lost. Again: soundness of mind and rectitude of heart were also destroyed; and
this is the corruption of the natural talents. For although we retain some
portion of understanding and judgment together with the will, yet we cannot
say that our mind is perfect and sound. Reason... being a natural talent, it
could not be totally destroyed, but is partly debilitated..." I say, "The
Empire never ended."
<P>

<li>The Empire is the institution, the codification, of derangement; it is
insane and imposes its insanity on us by violence, since its nature is a
violent one.
<P>

<li>To fight the Empire is to be infected by its derangement. This is a
paradox: whoever defeats a segment of the Empire becomes the Empire; it
proliferates like a virus, imposing its form on its enemies. Thereby it
becomes its enemies.
<P>

<li>Against the Empire is posed the living information, the plasmate or
physician, which we know as the Holy Spirit or Christ discorporate. These are
the two principles, the dark (the Empire) and the light (the plasmate). In the
end, Mind will give victory to the latter. Each of us will die or survive
according to which he aligns himself and his efforts with. Each of us contains
a component of each. Eventually one or the other component will triumph in
each human. Zoroaster knew this, because the Wise Mind informed him. He was
the first savior. Four have lived in all. A fifth is about to be born, who
will differ from the others: he will rule and he will judge us.
<P>

<li>Since the universe is actually composed of information, then it can be
said that information will save us. This is the saving <I>gnosis</I> which the
Gnostics sought. There is no other road to salvation. However, this
information&#151;or more precisely the ability to read and understand this
information, the universe as information&#151;can only be made available to us
by the Holy Spirit. We cannot find it on our own. Thus it is said that we are
saved by the grace of God and not by good works, that all salvation belongs to
Christ, who, I say, is a physician.
<P>

<li>In seeing Christ in a vision I correctly said to him, "We need medical
attention." In the vision there was an insane creator who destroyed what he
created, without purpose; which is to say, irrationally. This is the deranged
streak in the Mind; Christ is our only hope, since we cannot now call on
Asklepios. Asklepios came before Christ and raised a man from the dead; for
this act, Zeus had a Kyklopes slay him with a thunderbolt. Christ also was
killed for what he had done: raising a man from the dead. Elijah brought a boy
back to life and disappeared soon thereafter in a whirlwind. "The Empire never
ended."
<P>

<li>The physician has come to us a number of times under a number of names.
But we are not yet healed. The Empire identified him and ejected him. This
time he will kill the Empire by phagocytosis.
<p>

<li><b>TWO SOURCE COSMOGONY:</b> The One was and was-not, combined, and desired to
separate the was-not from the was. So it generated a diploid sac which
contained, like an eggshell, a pair of twins, each an androgyny, spinning in
opposite directions (the Yin and Yang of Taoism, with the One as the Tao). The
plan of the One was that both twins would emerge into being (was-ness)
simultaneously; however, motivated by a desire to be (which the One implanted
in both twins), the counter-clockwise twin broke through the sac and separated
prematurely; i.e. before full term. This was the dark or Yin twin. Therefore
it was defective. At full term the wiser twin emerged. Each twin formed a
unitary entelechy, a single living organism made of <I>psyche</I> and <I>soma</I>, still
rotating in opposite directions to each other. The full term twin, called Form
I by Parmenides, advanced correctly through its growth stages, but the
prematurely born twin, called Form II, languished.

<P>

<P>

The next step in the One's plan was that the Two would become the Many,
through their dialetic interaction. From them as hyperuniverses they projected
a hologram-like interface, which is the pluriform universe we creatures
inhabit. The two sources were to intermingle equally in maintaining our
universe, but Form II continued to languish toward illness, madness and
disorder. These aspects she projected into our universe.
<P>

It was the One's purpose for our hologramatic universe to serve as a teaching
instrument by which a variety of new lives advanced until ultimately they
would be isomorphic with the One. However, the decaying condition of
hyperuniverse II introduced malfactors which damaged our hologramatic
universe. This is the origin of entropy, undeserved suffering, chaos and
death, as well as the Empire, the Black Iron Prison; in essence, the aborting
of the proper health and growth of the life forms within the hologramatic
universe. Also, the teaching function was grossly impaired, since only the
signal from the hyperuniverse I was information-rich; that from II had become
noise.
<P>

The psyche of hyperuniverse I sent a micro-form of itself into hyperuniverse
II to attempt to heal it. The micro-form was apparent in our hologramatic
universe as Jesus Christ. However, hyperuniverse II, being deranged, at once
tormented, humiliated, rejected and finally killed the micro-form of the
healing psyche of her healthy twin. After that, hyperuniverse II continued to
decay into blind, mechanical, purposeless causal processes. It then became the
task of Christ (more properly the Holy Spirit) to either rescue the life forms
in the hologramatic universe, or abolish all influences on it emanating from
II. Approaching its task with caution, it prepared to kill the deranged twin,
since she cannot be healed; i.e. she will not allow herself to be healed
because she does not not understand that she is sick. This illness and madness
pervades us and makes us idiots living in private, unreal worlds. The original
plan of the One can only be realized now by the division of hyperuniverse I
into two healthy hyperuniverses, which will transform the hologramatic
universe into the successfull teaching machine it was designed to be. We will
experience this as the "Kingdom of God."
<P>

Within time, hyperuniverse II remains alive: "The Empire never ended." But in
eternity, where the hyperuniverses exist, she has been killed&#151;of necessity&#151;by 
the healthy twin of hyperuniverse I, who is our champion. The One
grieves for this death, since the One loved both twins; therefore the
information of the Mind consists of a tragic tale of the death of a woman, the
undertones of which generate anguish into all the creatures of the
hologrammatic universe without their knowing why. This grief will depart when
the healthy twin undergoes mitosis and the "Kingdom of God" arrives. The
machinery for this transformation&#151;the procession within time from the Age
of Iron to the Age of Gold&#151;is at work now; in eternity it is already
accomplished.
<P>

<li><b>ON OUR NATURE.</b> It is proper to say: we appear to be memory coils (<A href="meme/DNA.html">DNA</a>
carriers capable of experience) in a computer-like thinking system which,
although we have correctly recorded and stored thousands of years of
experiental information, and each of us possesses somewhat different deposits
from all the other life forms, there is a malfunction&#151;a failure&#151;of memory
retrieval . There lies the trouble in our particular subcircuit. "Salvation"
through <I>gnosis</I>&#151;more properly anamnesis (the loss of amnesia)&#151;although
it has individual significance for each of us&#151;a quantum leap in perception,
identity, cognition, understanding, world- and self-experience, including
immortality&#151;it has greater and further importance for the system as a
whole, inasmuch as these memories are data needed by it and valuable to it, to
its overall functioning.
<P>

Therefore it is in the process of self-repair, which includes: rebuilding our
subcircuit via linear and orthogonal time changes, as well as continual
signaling to us to stimulate blocked memory banks within us to fire and hence
retrieve what is there.
<P>

The external information or <I>gnosis</I>, then consists of disinhibiting
instructions, with the core content actually intrinsic to us&#151;that is,
already there (first observed by Plato; <I>viz</I>: that learning is a form of
remembering).
<P>

The ancients possessed techniques (sacraments and rituals) used largely in the
Greco-Roman mystery religions, including early Christianity, to induce firing
and retrieval, mainly with a sense of its restorative value to the
individuals; the Gnostics, however, correctly saw the ontological value to
what they called the Godhead Itself, the total entity.
<P>

<li>Two realms there are, upper and lower. The upper, derived from
hyperuniverse I or Yang, Form I of Parmenides, is sentient and volitional. The
lower realm, or Yin, Form II of Parmenides, is mechanical, driven by blind,
efficient cause, deterministic and without intelligence, since it emanates
from a dead source. In ancient times it was termed "astral determinism." We
are trapped, by and large, in the lower realm, but are through the sacraments,
by means of the plasmate, extricated. Until astral determinism is broken, we
are not even aware of it, so occluded are we. "The Empire never ended."
<P>

<li>The name of the healthy twin, hyperuniverse I, is Nommo. [Nommo is
represented in a fish form, the early Christian fish.] The name of the sick
twin, hyperuniverse II, is Yurugu. These names are known to the Dogon people
of western Sudan in Africa.
<P>

<li>The primordial source of all our religions lies with the ancestors of the
Dogon tribe, who got their cosmogony and cosmology directly from the
three-eyed invaders who visited long ago. The three-eyed invaders are mute and
deaf and telepathic, could not breathe our atmosphere, had the elongated
misshapen skull of Ikhnaton, and emanated from a planet in the star-system
Sirius. Although they had no hands, but had, instead, pincer claws such as a
crab has, they were great builders. They covertly influence our history toward
a fruitful end.
