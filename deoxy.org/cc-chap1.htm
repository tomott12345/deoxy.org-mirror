<h2>Chapter 1: The Proposal</h2>

<h3>CyberCraft, An Interpretative Metaphor</h3>

     Welcome to the CyberCraft Manual. We hope you will enjoy and
benefit from this little exploration into the majikal mind-body
complex.  Our purpose is to help others operate at higher levels
on all planes of life.  It isn't our purpose to help them just
feel better. Witchcraft has some very positive and life affirming
teachings. The authors of this document hope to interpret those
metaphors bringing them into a late 20th century framework from
which we can springboard into the 21st century.
<p>
     However we have strong forces to compete against.  The first
struggle we are involved with is one of the mind-body complex.
Who will control our mind-bodies?  Will it be the Aspirant, the
one looking for a better life, or will it be the Controllers, the
ones with the power and monies to mold our minds to their
purposes? And will we nurture the emerging Changelings?  Or do we
let the Persecutors administer the Last Rite to our offspring?
<p>
     CyberCraft is not meant to be an end in itself.  CyberCraft
is the art of living smart.  We hope that it will offer the
Aspirant the options needed to create a better world to live in.
Additionally CyberCraft is a psycho-spiritual metaphor for the
21st century.  This metaphor is based upon embodiment spirituality
whereas others are based upon disembodiment spirituality.
<p>
     CyberCraft is the art of living that integrates rational and
irrational process through mythopoetic structures primarily from
Wicca, then neo-Paganism and other related religious belief
systems.  It should incorporate knowledge from newer and emerging
humanistic sciences.  Principles of ethical self-programming as
written of by <a href="leary.htm">Timothy Leary</a>, <a href="lilly.htm">John Lilly</a>, <a href="raw.htm">Robert Anton Wilson</a>,
<a href="geoman.htm">Antero Alli</a>, and Christopher Hyatt should be incorporated into the
relational processes; those setting between solar and lunar
knowledge.  CyberCraft is a self-modifying tradition.  It will
change as culture changes.  CyberCraft is also a psycho-spiritual
metaphor which will generate, sanctify and venerate the necessary
tools for enjoying a healthy mind and body.
<p>      
     The above mentioned authors are helping to shed light upon
our thought processes. The terms and structures they use should be
considered metaphorical.  But they provide a viable framework from
which to build a newer, more appropriate belief system for our
times.
<p>
     Humans seem to have a need to be both rational and irrational
at the same time. In doing so we generate quite a few problems and
reap some benefits. At this point in human time we are not able to
measure magik, nor are we able to measure or sense the so called
etheric or astral. Providing that we are given time and if the
interests are still mounted, we may be able to invent measuring or
sensing devices for such indeterminate quantities.
<p>
     Further the practice of dividing the mind from the body has
broken sunder the human even further.  For the purposes of
CyberCraft the mind-body is one complex, one swirl of energy. The
mind and body are one entity, undivided, inseparable, and
indivisible.
<p>
     It is the opinion of this author that many features of the
powers are misunderstood. Over the centuries and in various
cultures humans have overlaid folk fables and their personal
expectations of what the powers are into the framework of human
abilities. And in doing so needless baggage has crept into the
consensus framework.  It is time that we looked at our human
nature without the clouded and marred lens of binary, Christian,
Ceremonial and patriarchal expectations.
<p>
     At the base of the concern humans are animal by definition.
Human magik should firstly be animal magik.  But does that mean we
should be satisfied with an animal expectation of what our
abilities can be? Should we push back the normal or natural
boundaries? How far?
<p>
     The first order of business is to know ourselves. Does this
mean know just our bodies?  How about desires? How about hopes,
dreams and aspirations?  How about our minds? Why should we remain
ignorant of why and how we think? Do we know now? Or do we think
we know without really knowing?  What part do preconceived
concepts play in the formulation of that sentiment? How do our
respective cultures help us define our consciousness?  Are these
definitions useful?  What can be replaced? With what?
<p>
     It is useful to frame these questions in the milieu of the
human mind.  Everything we can think of is thought with the bio-computer we term the brain.  How does the brain work?  Research effort is still in progress but at the core we find that the brain
is composed of billions of cell bundles called neurons.  Each
neuron could have as many as 10,000 gateways to other neurons.  We
know that information is transmitted electro-chemically at about
.07 volts.  But we don't know everything yet. And least of all we
don't know why we think what we think.
<p>     
     CyberCraft should be a psychological-religious-political
thought system to meet and support the needs of individuals who
feel both a romantic and classical approach is needed in their
life.  These needs should be formatted into solar and lunar
knowledge bases, ie., rational and irrational modes with
relational processes sitting midway betwixt them.  These should be
used to a maximal degree.
<p>
     Humans are discovering that there is pity poor little
difference between political and religious systems. In fact
religious systems replace the tribal chief or monarch with a
discarnate chief or monarch.  This eases the task of governing the
populace through the revelations and commandments of the
discarnate and absent ruler from on high. Humans always fear most
what they cannot see, understand or comprehend. And we always fear
the invisible punisher; the inner punisher who knows our greatest
fears.  Consequently religious systems are political systems of a
supplementary order.  Political systems should be considered
metareligious systems in that political concerns lay at the base
of or stand behind religious concerns. Religious systems are
political systems of an inner nature.
<p>
     Understanding our thoughts should become a little easier in
the solar (daylight consciousness) and lunar (twilight
consciousness) framework.  Additionally many other modes of
consciousness could be mounted which straddle these tropes.  These
should be termed the relational or relative processes.
<p>
     Electronic and chemical assistance for modifying
consciousness might be useful in helping to determine how
individuals might drive ethically chosen programming deep into the
psyche.  But once the message is received we should hang the phone
up on chemical boosters. A new generation of brain machine is on
the market today.  Recently we have had the opportunity to test
drive a model of the audio-visual and suggestion type. The
experience was positive.
<p>
     CyberCraft should incorporate many of the concepts contained
in Humanist Manifesto II.
<p>
     Secular humanists have pioneered many valuable ideas needful
in today's ever evolving political and social environments.
CyberNauts should augment some humanistic concepts with high
technology answers to pressing personal questions. And in applying
technology to human service systems we might make a difference not
only in our little corner of the planet but elsewhere.
<p>
     CyberCraft should foster a new class of technology termed
GreenTech.  GreenTech should be those technologies which recycle
and/or conserve the Matrix's natural resources.
<p>
     CyberCraft is a new psycho-spiritual system that is more
importantly a mode of thinking.  Smart thinking usually leads to
smart living.  Additionally the application of CyberCraft to
mundane life should be easy and seamless.  Instead of taking the
individual out of the social complex it should enable them to
integrate easily with the social composite.
<p>
     All human structures spawn from the human mind.  More
powerful modes of thinking are needed to help us along our way in
an ever increasingly propaganda polluted knowledge environment.
We should take into our own hands the facilities to make rational,
relative and irrational decisions void of fear of the outcome and
infatuation of the process.
<p>
     CyberCraft should appeal to the atheist as well as the
religionist as it focuses upon mythopoetic stories and structures
and the mystical connections between what is and is not seen, as
opposed to dogmatic theoretical structures.  CyberCraft emphasizes
relationship over religion. This author believes that most of the
world's religions are based upon self-deception. These self-deceptions are usually meant to smooth difficult passages in life.
But we should be honest with ourselves. To know ourselves we have
to cope well with those human events that cause us much pain.
Instead of telling ourselves pretty fairytales we need to work in
harmony with our natures.  But first we need to know what our
nature is. And then with greater understanding we can modify that
nature.
<p>
     The archetypes of Wicca, paganism and other systems should be
thought of as patterns usefull for programming the human
experience and the relationships between the various existant
lifeforms.
<p>
     In Scott Peck's book A DIFFERENT DRUMMER he surmises the
following transitions for the religiously oriented.
<p>
     First is a stage of naivete in which the human mind/body
complex is not programed.
<p>
     Then follows a phase of organization in which the mind/body
complex is programed by an acceptable religious structure.  Over
time the individual discovers that the religious structure is
focused in ways undesirable to the follower. Stick is mounted upon
stone until a way of escape is formulated which provides an
honorable withdrawal.
<p>
     Sometime afterwards the individual discovers they are bitter
because of some single or multiple set of experiences. This stage
is marked by some form of agnosticism or atheism.  It's a
rejection of the organized systems which tend to exploit the
seeker, the single, the separate and lonely for financial and
political gains.
<p>
     Still the seeker needs to feel they are a part of something
greater than the individual alone. A mystic phase encroaches
whereupon a glimmer of hope is seen in the natural intricacies of
life. Generally the mystic phase has an eclectic twist as the bio-computer selectively compares, accepts and rejects concepts and
structures which are useful or not.  This experience is intensely
personal.  In many cases the experience is not expressible as
words to describe the framework are found wanting.
<p>
     Theoretical structures should be included as long as they are
considered metaphorical structures or models existing within the
human mind first and foremost. These structures can then be used
to ferret out deep personal meaning.
<p>
     The paragraph above is the patented anti-dogma catma. The
catma is needed to remind us the menu is not the meal; that mental
apprehensions of a reality are not the realities themselves. Meow!
A valuable demonstration of this is the simple exercise of saying
aloud the word pinch. Then give the your arm a good pinch. Think
about the difference.

<h2>External Faces - Public</h2>

<h3>Domains</h3>

     Domains are used metaphorically. More properly they represent
areas of interest. Higher and lower relate to density more than
social, cultural or ethical placement.  However higher and lower
still display some cultural heritage.  Higher should normally
refer to more dense, and thus would usually be considered the
Lower Kingdoms in most disembodiment or spirit focused theoretical
structures. For the purposes of CyberCraft solar processes can be
considered High Domain Processes, the relational processes as the
Mid Domain processes and the lunar processes as Low Domain
Processes.
<p>
     This is a reversal of the usual spirit based structures which
drive the initiate into seclusion and poverty.  CyberCraft need be
neither ascetic nor bothersome. If CyberCraft arrives at a
framework which is not enjoyable the CyberCraft needs to die and
be reborn.
<p>
     Higher refers to the relative density of matter.  The human
sciences are more appropriate for humans, the spirit sciences more
appropriate for spirits.  In the high domains herbal lore and
self-help topics are more the rule than the exception.

<h3>Religious Aspects - Low Domain</h3>

     The metaphorical Low Domain is the domain of Relationship.
It's the basis of the religious belief system should reflect
WoMankind's ethical relationship to their home planet and
humanity.  Depending upon personal focus the Earth can be
personified or considered the Grandmother or Mother of WoMankind.
It should be called Gaea, Gaia, Mom, Mother or the Matrix, the
space enabling the existence of all physical and non-physical
local planetary lifeforms.  The involved solar processes should
consider this a 'self check' to prohibit WoMankind from polluting
their environment to the detriment of all lifeforms.
<p>
     Other Matrixes may exist. CyberCraft should be concerned with
local planetary manifestations without denying the existences of
other Matrixes.
<p>     
     The Matrix is paired with Patrus, which is symbolic of
everything which has happened to and upon the Matrix. Included
phenomena are geologic events, meteorological events, intrusions
from outside the Matrix, meteor impacts, panspermia arrivals and
direct interventions of space faring races. In a sense the Patrus
can be thought of as the evolutional processes or history of all
life on the Matrix. Where the Matrix and Patrus overlap, intersect
or connect, life forms.
<p>
     Other personified or romantic entities should exist within
the matrix.  These should be the Lady and Lord and be more
important or of a relatively more immediate nature being seen as
doorways to other entities, other spaces, physical energetic
natures or psychic spaces. Frequently the Lady and Lord should be
celebrated as the perfect patterns of WoMankind. Matrix and Patrus
along with Lady and Lord should be remembered at every fullmoon
celebration.
<h3>
     Working of the Craft - Mid Domain
</h3>
     The metaphorical Mid Domain should be the workings of the
Craft. At first the emphasis should be upon physical
representations of the Mid Domain.  Special tools should be
selected for an individual or group. These tools may or may not
reflect traditional usage but should be more appropriate for a
culture and/or geographical locale than for a traditional usage.
<p>
     Special robes may be appropriate.  Nudity should be more
useful for metaprograming.  The individual's background should be
considered before choosing tools or coverings. If the individual
were normally a naturist the metaprograming tool could be robes,
etc.
<p>
     Tools and rituals should be used for immediate metaprograming
efforts.  Dramatic ritual should be used to advantage for both
individual programming or group alignment.
<p>
     Experiments in communication with non-physical or discarnate
entities should be a focus. New modes of relationship in sexual or
emotional life should be incorporated providing members feel
comfortable with the activities. Safety, both physical and
emotional, should be paramount. Training of individuals for
incorporation may be needed to assist them in their growth into
unknown areas.
<p>
     An important focus of the Mid Domian is the creation and
maintainence of Will. Today's human has been robbed of Will.
Cybercraft hopes to generate and utilize appropriate ritual and
programming techniques to accomplish this goal.
<h3>
     Incorporated Physical Sciences - High Domain
</h3>
     The metaphorical High Domain should be the human and physical
knowledge systems, ie, health (birthing, child care and physical
health), nutritional, exercise, cosmetic and creative knowledge
systems, ie.  sewing, cooking, building sciences, gardening and
organic farming techniques, and personal defense techniques.
<p>
     CyberCraft should initially provide the framework for
immersion in a Domain. The individual or group should decide for
themselves what extent they need to go.
<h3>
    Organization
</h3>
    CyberCraft should attempt to incorporate proven techniques of
cell or smaller group management while retaining intimacy.
CyberCraft leaders could be of either sex, of any sexual
preference, but must be emotionally sound. They may choose their
own names and titles.  Or CyberCraft may assign a title in order
to establish a somewhat formalized but unrestricted tradition. We
suggest these classifications:
<blockquote>
<dl><dt><strong>Aspirant</strong></dt><dd>an inquiring mind of reasonably good health</dd>
    <dt><strong>CyberNaut</strong></dt><dd>a human moving from Four to Eight Circuits, an apprentice CyberPriest/ess</dd>
    <dt><strong>CyberPriest/ess</strong></dt><dd>a fully functioning Eight Circuit human</dd>
    <dt><strong>Transitioner</strong></dt><dd>a young or eight circuit human showing signs of physical metamorphosis</dd>
    <dt><strong>New Human</strong></dt><dd>a fully functioning transitioned human
    <dt><strong>Cyberim</strong></dt><dd>the total complex of those practicing CyberCraft.</dd>
</dl></blockquote>
     Group or cell size should be held to about 2 to 15. However
any number of cell members may be used providing genuine intimacy
is maintained.
<p>
     CyberCraft should attempt to meet the economic and political
needs of its members. Resources are available that address
political activities in cells. An economic infrastructure must be
established in CyberCraft method. Should a social threat arise
individual members may need to support themselves in a strange or
difficult environment.  Personal enrichment and empowerment as
opposed to personal aggrandizement should be the focus enabling
the member to live well in any difficult or strange economic or
political environment.
<h3>
     Emotional Requirements
</h3>
     What part does love play in CyberCraft?  Love in its various
shades and flavors permeate CyberCraft.  From love of Mother and
Father, to love of knowledge and wisdom, to the lust and love of
ones lover, on to love of pleasure of the mind-body complex, love
of the patterns one manifests through, including the love of
changing one's world to finally the love of navigating the non-local passages between the worlds. Yes love plays a vital part.
But we are not so naive to assume that only one type of love
exists.  Many different shades and flavors make up this rainbow of
emotion.  CyberCraft should experience and emphasize as many
different forms of love as possible.

<h2>Internal Faces</h2>

     These are internal considerations not usually presentable to
the public at large. Pearls are delicate. We need not dirty them.
Internal faces can be determined at a later time.
