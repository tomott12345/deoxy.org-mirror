<h2><a name="arc">1 - Archaic Revival</a></h2>
History is ending because the dominator culture has led the human species
into a blind alley, and as the inevitable chaostrophie approaches, people
look for metaphors and answers. Every time a culture gets into trouble it
casts itself back into the past looking for the  last sane moment it ever
knew.  And the last sane moment we  ever knew was on the plains of Africa
15,000 years ago rocked in the cradle of the Great Horned Mushroom Goddess
before history, before standing armies, before slavery and property, before
warfare and phonetic alphabets and monotheism, before, before, before. And
this is where  the future is taking us  because the secret faith of the
twentieth century is not modernism, the secret faith of the twentieth
century is nostalgia for the archaic, nostalgia for the paleolithic, and
that gives us body piercing, abstract 
<a href="http://www.cnam.fr/wm/paint/glo/expressionism/" target="remotes">expressionism</a>,

rock-n-roll</a> and catastrophe theory.  The 20th century mind is 
nostalgic for the paradise that once existed on the mushroom dotted 
plains of Africa where the plant-human symbiosis occurred that pulled us 
out of the animal body and into the tool-using, culture-making, 
imagination-exploring creature that we are.  And why does this matter?  
It matters because it shows that the way out is back and that the future 
is a forward escape into the past.  This is what the psychedelic 
experience means.  Its a doorway out of history and into the wiring under 
the board in eternity. And I tell you this because if the community 
understands what it is that holds it together the community will be 
better able to streamline itself for flight into <a href="hyper.htm">
hyperspace</a> because what we need is a new myth, what we need is a new true
story that tells us where we're going in the universe and that true story
is that the ego is a product of pathology, and when psilocybin is regularly
part of the human experience the ego is supressed and the supression of the
ego means the defeat of the dominators, the materialists, the product
peddlers.  Psychedelics return us to the inner worth of the self, to the
importance of the feeling of immediate experience - and nobody can sell
that to you and nobody can buy it from you, so the dominator culture is not
interested in the felt presence of immediate experience, but that's what
holds the community together. And as we break out of the silly myths of
science, and the infantile obsessions of the marketplace what we discover
through the psychedelic experience is that in the body, IN THE BODY, there
are Niagras of beauty, alien beauty, alien dimensions that are part of the
self, the richest part of life.  I think of going to the grave without
having a psychedelic experience like going to the grave without ever having
sex. It means that you never figured out what it is all about. The mystery
is in the body and the way the body works itself into nature. What the
Archaic Revival means is shamanism, ecstacy, orgiastic sexuality, and the
defeat of the three enemies of the people. And the three enemies of the
people are hegemony, monogamy and monotony! And if you get them on the run
you have the dominators sweating folks, because that means your getting it
all reconnected, and getting it all reconnected means putting aside the
idea of separateness and self-definition through thing-fetish. Getting it
all connected means tapping into the Gaian mind, and the Gaian mind is what
we're calling the psychedelic experience. Its an experience of the living
fact of the entelechy of the planet. And without that experience we wander
in a desert of bogus ideologies. But with that experience the compass of
the self can be set, and that's the idea; figuring out how to reset the
compass of the self through community, through ecstatic dance, through
psychedelics, sexuality, intelligence, INTELLIGENCE. This is what we have
to have to make the forward escape into hyperspace.

<h2><a name="ali">3 - Alien Love</a></h2>

Hello... So that was like an introduction, now for some preaching to the
choir on the subject of how come it is that the further in you go the
bigger it gets. I remember the very, very first time that I smoked DMT. It
was sort of a benchmark you might say, and I remember that this friend of
mine that always got there first visited me with this little glass pipe and
this stuff which looked like orange mothballs. And since I was a graduate
of Dr. Hoffman's I figured there were no surprises. So the only question I
asked is, 'How long does it last?' and he said, 'About five minutes.' So I
did it and... (long pause, audience cheers) there was a something, like a
flower, like a chrysanthemum in orange and yellow that was sort of spinning,
spinning, and then it was like I was pushed from behind and I fell through
the chrysanthemum into another place that didn't seem like a state of mind,
it seemed like another place. And what was going on in this place aside from
the tastefully socketed indirect lighting, and the crawling geometric
hallucinations along the domed walls, what was happening was that there were
a lot of ahh.. beings in there, what I call self-transforming machine elves.
Sort of like jewelled basketballs all dribbling their way toward me. And if
they'd had faces they would have been grinning, but they didn't have faces.
And they assured me that they loved me and they told me not to be amazed;
not to give way to astonishment. And so I watched them, even though I
wondered if maybe I hadn't really done it this time, and what they were
doing was they were making objects come into existence by singing them into
existence. Objects which looked like Faberge eggs from Mars morphing them-
selves with mandiean(sp) alphabetical structures. They looked like the
concrescence of liguistic intentionality put through a kind of hyper-dimensional 
transform into three-dimensional space. And these little machines
offered themselves to me. And I realized when I looked at them that if I
could bring just one of these little trinkets back, nothing would ever be
quite the same again. And I wondered, Where Am I? And What Is Going On? It
occurred to me that these must be holographic viral projections from an
autonomous continuum that was somehow intersecting my own, and then I thought
a more elegant explaination would be to take it at face value and realize
that I had broken into an ecology of souls. And that somehow I was getting a
peek over the other side. Somehow I was finding out that thing that you
cheerfully assume you can't find out. But it felt like I was finding out.
And it felt.. and then I can't remember what it felt like because the little
self-transforming tykes interrupted me and said, 'Don't think about it. Don't
think about who you are. Think about doing what we're doing. Do it. Do it now.
DO IT!!'
<h2><a name="spe">4 - Speaking in Tongues</a></h2>
And what they meant was use your voice to make an object. And as I understood,
I felt a bubble kind of grow inside of me. And I watched these little elf
tykes jumping in and out of my chest; they like to do that to reassure you.
And they said, 'Do it.' And I felt language rise up in me that was unhooked
from english, and I began to speak.. like this, 'Ehh yo ca dem wa, etc..
 .. or words to that effect. And I 
wondered then what it all meant and why it felt so good if it didn't mean
anything. And I thought about it, a few years actually, and I decided that
meaning and language are two different things. And that what the alien voice
in the psychedelic experience wants to reveal is the syntactical nature of
reality. That the real secret of magic is that the world is made of words,
and that if you know the words that the world is made of you can make of it
whatever you wish. (More unintelligible tongue here..) And one of the things
that I learned about DMT was that if you've ever had it, even just once, then
you can have a dream, and in this dream somebody will pull out a little glass
pipe, and then it will happen! It will happen just like the real thing.
Because there's a button somewhere inside each and every one of us that
gives you a look into the other side. And that's the button that resets
the compass that tells you where you want to sail. Good luck...
<p><a href="h_twha3.htm"><font size=-1>next in the hyperspace series</font></a>
<h2><a name="tim">6 - Timewave Zero</a></h2>
Hello.. alright. Have you ever noticed how ahh, there's this quality to
reality which comes and goes, and kind of ebbs and flows and nobody ever
mentions it or has a name for it except some people call it a 'bad hair day'
or some people say 'Things are really weird recently.' And I think we never
notice it and we never talk about it because we're embedded in a culture
that expects us to believe that all times are the same, and that your bank
account doesn't fluctuate except according to the vicissitudes of your own
existence. In other words, every moment is expected to be the same and yet
this isn't what we experience. And so what I noticed was that running
through reality is <a href="http://www.levity.com/eschaton/novelty.html" target="remotes">
the ebb and flow of novelty</a>. And some days, and some
years, and some centuries are very novel indeed, and some ain't. And they
come and go on all scales differently, interweaving, resonating. And this
is what time seems to be. And Science has overlooked this, this most
salient of facts about nature: that nature is a novelty conserving engine.
And that from the very first moments of that most improbable big bang,
novelty has been conserved because in the very beginning there was only an
ocean of energy pouring into the universe. There were no planets, no stars,
no molecules, no atoms, no magnetic fields; there was only an ocean of free
electrons. And then time passed and the universe cooled and novel structures
crystallized out of disorder. First, atoms; atoms of hydrogen and helium
aggregating into stars. And at the center of those stars the temperature
and the pressure created something which had never been seen before which
was fusion. And fusion cooking in the hearts of stars brought forth more
novelty: heavy elements - iron, carbon, four-valent carbon. And as time
passed there were not only then elementary systems but because of the
presence of carbon and the lower temperatures in the universe, molecular
structures. And out of molecules come simple subsets of organism. The
genetic machinery for transcripting information, aggregating into
membranes, always binding novelty, always condensing time, always building
and conserving upon complexity, and always faster and faster and faster.
And then we come to ourselves. And where do WE fit into all of this. Five
million years ago we were an animal of some sort. Where will we be five
million years from tonight? What we represent is not a sideshow, or an
epiphenomenon, or an ancillary something-or-other on the edge of nowhere.
What WE represent is the nexus of concrescent novelty that has been moving
itself together, complexifying itself, folding itself in upon itself for
billions and billions of years. There is, so far as we know, nothing more
advanced than what is sitting behind your eyes. The human neocortex is the
most densely ramified complexified structure in the known universe. We are
the cutting edge of organismic transformation of matter in this cosmos. And
this has been going on for a while; since the discovery of fire, since the
discovery of language. But now, and by now I mean in the last 10,000 years,
we've been into something new. Not genetic information, not genetic mutation,
not natural selection, but epigenetic activity: writing, theatre, poetry,
dance, art, tattooing, body piercing and philisophy. And these things have
accelerated the ingression into novelty so that we have become an idea
excreting force in nature that builds temples, builds cities, builds
machines, social engines, plans, and spreads over the Earth, into space,
into the micro-physical domain, into the micro-physical domain. We, who five
million years ago were animals, can kindle in our deserts and if necesary
upon the cities of our enemies the very energy which lights the stars at
night. Now, something peculiar is going on here. Something is calling us
out of nature and sculpting us in it's own image. And the confrontation
with this something is now not so far away. This is what the impending
apparent end of everything actually means. It means that the de-no-ma(?) of
human history is about to occur and is about to be revealed as a universal
process of compressing and expressing novelty that is now going to become
so intensified that it is going to flow over into another dimension.
<p>
   You can feel it. You can feel it in your own dreams. You can feel it in
your own trips. You can feel that we're approaching the cusp of a
catastrophe, and that beyond that cusp we are unrecognizable to ourselves.
The wave of novelty that has rolled unbroken since the birth of the
universe has now focussed and coalesced itself in our species. And if it
seems unlikely to you that the world is about to transform itself, then
think of it this way: think of a pond, and think of how if the surface of
the pond begins to boil -  that's the signal that some enormous protean form
is about to break the surface of the pond and reveal itself. Human history
IS the boiling of the pond surface of ordinary biology. We are flesh which
has been caught in the grip of some kind of an attractor that lies ahead
of us in time, and that is sculpting us to its ends; speaking to us through
psychedelics, through visions, through culture, and technology,
consciousness. The language forming capacity in our species is propelling
itself forward as though it were going to shed the monkey body and leap
into some extra-surreal space that surrounds us, but that we can not
currently see. Even the people who run the planet, the World Bank, the IMF,
you name it, they know that history is ending. They know by the reports
which cross their desks: the disappearance of the ozone hole [?], the
toxification of the ocean, the clearing of the rain forests. What this means
is that the womb of the planet has reached its finite limits, and that the
human species has now, without choice, begun the decent down the birth canal
of collective transformation toward something right around the corner and
nearly completely unimaginable. And this is where the psychedelic shaman
comes is because I believe that what we really contact through psychedelics
is a kind of hyperspace. And from that hyperspace we look down on..., we look
down on both the past and the future, and we anticipate the end. And a shaman
is someone who has seen the end, and therefore is a trickster, because you
don't worry if you've seen the end. If you know how it comes out you go back
and you take your place in the play, and you let it all roll on without
anxiety. This is what boundary dissolution means. It means nothing less
than the anticipation of the end state of human history. A return to the
archaic mode. A rediscovery of the orgiastic freedom of the African
grasslands of 20,000 years ago. A techno-escape forward into a future that
looks more like the past than the future because materialism, consumerism,
product-fetishism, all of these things will be eliminated and technology
will become nanotechnology and disappear from our physical presence. If we
have the dream, if we allow the wave of novelty to propel us toward the
creativity that is inimitable to the human condition. That's what we're
talking about here: psychedelics as a catalyst to the human imagination,
psychedelics as a catalyst for language; because what cannot be said,
cannot be created by the community. So what we need then is the forced
evolution of language. And the way to do that is to go back to the agents
that created language in the very first place. And that means the
psychedelic plants, the Gaian Logos, and the mysterious, beckoning,
extraterrestrial minds beyond. Hooking ourselves back up in to the chakras
of the hierarchy of nature, turning ourselves over to the mind of the total
other that created us and brought us forth out of animal organization. We
are somehow part of the planetary destiny. How well we do determines how
well the experiment of life on Earth does, because we have become the
cutting edge of that experiment, we define it, and we hold in our hands the
power to make or to break it.
<p>
   This is not a dress rehearsal for the apocalypse. This is not a pseudo-millenium. 
This is the real thing folks. This is not a test. This is the
last chance before things become so dissipated that there is no chance for
cohesiveness. We can use the calender as a club. We can make the millenium
an occasion for establishing an authentic human civilization, overcoming
the dominator paradigm, dissolving boundaries through psychedelics,
recreating a sexuality not based on monotheism, monogamy and monotony. We..
All these things are possible if we can understand the overarching metaphor
which holds it together which is the celebration of mind as play, the
celebration of love as a genuine social value in the community. This is
what they have suppressed so long. This is why they are so afraid of the
psychedelics, because they understand that once you touch the inner core of
your own and someone else's being you can't be led into thing-fetishes and
consumerism. The message of psychedelics is that culture can be re-engineered 
as a set of emotional values rather than products. This is
terrifying news. And if we are able to make this point then we can pull
back, we can pull back and we can transcend. Nine times in the last million
years the ice has ground south from the poles pushing human populations
ahead of it and those people didn't fuck up. Why should we then? We are all
survivors. We are the inheritors of a million years of striving for the
unspeakable. And now with the engines of technology in our hands we ought to
be able to reach out and actually exteriorize the human soul at the end of
time, invoke it into existence like a UFO and open the violet doorway into
hyperspace and walk through it, out of profane history and into the world
beyond the grave, beyond shamanism, beyond the end of history, into the
galactic millenium that has beckoned to us for millions of years across
space and time. THIS IS THE MOMENT. A planet brings forth an opportunity
like this only once in its lifetime, and we are ready, and we are poised.
And as a community we are ready to move into it, to claim it, to make it
our own.
<p>
It's there. Go for it, and thank you.
