Newsgroups: alt.drugs<br>
From: J<br>
Subject: DMT/harmaline reports<br>
Date: Jul 1993<br>
<p>
I am posting these reports about the effects of oral DMT following oral harmaline ingestion for a friend. The DMT source was <a href="acacia.htm">Acacia phlebophylla</a>, the <a href="http://hyperreal.com/drugs/psychedelics/betacarbolines/harmala.info">harmaline source Peganum harmala</a>. I had nothing to do with the experiments, and so can't answer detailed questions about them.</small></blockquote>
<h1>ENTER THE DMT ROOM</h1>

	This article describes the visuals seen during 3 seperate DMT sessions 
using <a href="ayadef.htm">ayahuasca</a> and 
harmaline. To date, with the exception of
<a href="http://hyperreal.com/drugs/marijuana/">marijuana</a> and
<a href="http://hyperreal.com/drugs/inhalants/">nitrous oxide</a>, DMT is 
the only true psychedelic I have tried.
<p>
	Details of the first session can be found in an article called 
"Dr DMT (or how I learned to stop reality and love psychadelics)". The
second session was nowhere near as intense as the first, but did produce
some astounding (and more memorable) visuals. The third session was
done on a small amount of ayahuasca, combined with marijuana and nitrous
oxide.
<p>
The visuals are grouped together in stages of trip intensity. These are:
<ol>
<li><a href="h_dmtrom.htm#1">First noticable effects</a>,
<li><a href="h_dmtrom.htm#2">Entering the DMT room</a>,
<li><a href="h_dmtrom.htm#3">The DMT room</a>,
<li><a href="h_dmtrom.htm#4">The DMT universe</a>, and
<li><a href="h_dmtrom.htm#5">DMT reality</a>.
</ol>
<em>OEVs</em> refers to Open Eye Visuals<br>
<em>CEVs</em> are Closed Eye Visuals.<br>

<h2><a name="1">1.  First noticable effects.</a></h2>

(OEVs)
<p>
	The first noticable effect of the DMT was an indescribable oddness
in the air. The room looked different, but I couldn't quite put my
finger on it. After staring at near and far objects, glancing back and
forth, I noticed that there were subtle changes in perspective. Whilst
looking at a distant object, objects close to me seemed to move closer, 
and when I looked at the objects moving closer, the distant objects moved
further away.
<p>
	While looking around the room I also noticed that the lights seemed
brighter. I kept staring into the lights and noticed them moving slightly,
although others in the room insisted that they were still. The total
intensity of the room seemed to be constantly changing, although there 
was no natural light (all DMT to date has been taken after 10pm).
<p>
	Most of the movement in the room seemed to be out of the corner of
my eye, for instance, I'd look at something on the left side of the mantlepiece
and I was sure the things on the right side were moving, but when I looked
across they'd stopped.
<p>
(CEVs)
<p>
	The CEVs I saw were comparable to my marijuana visuals. Geometry
came and went, in the form of moving lines and polygons. There were no
intense colours or definitions, and I couldn't make out any particular
objects in amongst the haze.

<h2><a name="2">2.      Entering the DMT room.</a></h2>

(OEVs)
<p>
	When the DMT effects moved up a level, a colour change took place.
Fine textures (shirt fabric, for instance) were replaced by a single,
flat colour, as though my eyesight was rendered through a computer capable 
of only 16 colours. All scratches, dents and marks were removed from all
objects, giving them a new look. The new colours are bright, intense
and exciting to look at. All "boring" colour seem to disappear.
<p>
	Objects began shimmering, waving about as if they were made of thin
plastic and moving to invisible air currents. Objects with long, straight
lines would bend. Walls breathed. If I stared at an object, it would
either start breathing or melt into something else entirely. Once I 
realised what was happening it would quickly snap back to its original
form, only to start moving again when I resumed staring at it.
<p>
	Shadows on the walls seemed to rise up and form three dimensional
plataeus, then disappear again into the wall. I also noticed an effect
where panning my head around the room would result in a flickering of
my vision, as though I was looking through a fractured prism.
<p>
(CEVs)
<p>
	The geometry floating around in my head turned into definite shapes.
A corridor was formed, and I had the feeling that I was at one end and
wanted to make it through to the other. Objects formed out of the walls
of the corridor, the corridor spun around with me in it, doors opened
and closed. Roads and corridors have always seemed common in my
DMT trips. There was a definate sense of travel within me, I knew I
was going to go somewhere.

<h2><a name="3">3.      The DMT room.</a></h2>

(OEVs)
<p>
	The subtle changes from reality to the DMT room finally stopped.
Nothing was subtle anymore. Everything was changing. The room was still 
recognisable, but everything in it was moving, all the walls were breathing, 
and all of this was happening constantly. I'd look at an object, and it
would either move, change or disappear. Objects that were close together
would blend into a new object; first by forming pseudopodia and then by
moving closer together and enveloping eachother with them. 
<p>
	Objects basically still stayed where they were, and only objects 
that were close together tried to form new objects by mating with their
neighbours. I had no control over what was happening, I could only
sit back and watch. I did try to control what I hallucinated, but was
usually unsuccessful with one exception.
<p>
	I held a mirror in front of my face and watched my beard magically
lengthen, then shrink back. I tried to make my nose grow longer, and after
a few seconds, I was amazed to see it happen. It didn't grow by more than
a centimetre, but it did happen.
<p>
	I asked for several handfuls of pistaccio nuts, which I placed in
my lap. They felt odd to touch. They were soft and smooth, instead of
hard and sharp. I stared at them for a while, and the edges of the shells
turned into mouths, and suddenly I was staring into a collection of
eyeless grinning creatures. I smiled back. They seemed happy.
<p>
	My hands fascinated me for minutes. I'd look at them and then realise 
that there were objects moving underneath the surface. Large white bone
type objects were rising from the depths of my arm until they were just
under the surface, stretching the skin. The hair on my forearms looked
like sea kelp, moving to invisible currents. A change of perspective
followed that made the hairs on my arm seem two metres long, and I was
staring at real sea kelp, life size, coming out of my gigantic arm.
<p>
	My fingers changed in length constantly, and my knuckles moved so 
that the part of my fingers that could bend seemed to be changing.
<p>
	I looked at the back of my hand, and spread my fingers apart. Webbing
magically appeared and joined the gaps between my fingers, and then the
colour of my hands changed to a deep orange, similar to the colour of
cooked duck's feet. 
<p>
	As I moved my eyes down my arm, I saw printed circuit board tracks
materialize on my skin, then run down my arm. Underneath the skin I
could see mechanical contraptions that moved everything.
<p>
	I found regular geometric patterns almost intolerable by this stage.
I prefered to close my eyes and see geometry there, rather than
open my eyes and experience total confusion. Even though I still realised
where I was, I was too confused by the moving of once familiar objects
to stay in the DMT room open eyed for too long.
<p>
(CEVs)
<p>
	The shapes increased in complexity, the rooms got larger and more
crowded with wierd machines and contraptions, and the activity that was
going on seemed to intensify. Things were coming out of "walls" in these
virtual "rooms" with an odd regularity in their timing.
<p>
Amongst a million other visuals, I remember
<p>
<ul>
<li>A huge dinosaur made of Lego bricks lift out of the right hand side 
  wall of a room and melt into the ceiling.

<li>An incredibly wierd machine, perhaps as large as a coal excavator,
  moving slowly from one side of an enormous building to another,
  prompting the quote "Who the f*ck would design something that
  looks like that!" Others in the room asked "What?", and I replied
  with "A spaceship that looks like Mick Jagger".

<li>A being made of chocolate milk drops playing the keys of an invisible
  piano. No music or sound occured in any of these visuals, but I did
  recognise it as a piano.

<li>A cubic room full of black and white tiles, with the corner of each tile
  holding an eye. The room changed to some trapezoidal shape, and out of 
  the far wall came two large cubic objects, still covered in tiles, 
  with beckoning arms. The two large objects on the far wall split apart 
  to join with the left and right walls, revealing a door on the far side. 
  The door opened, but I couldn't go through and this frustrated me at 
  the time. 
</ul>
	All the visuals seemed real. I felt as though I could reach out and
touch them. Some of the more insane and fun visuals I experienced while
closing my eyes, and watching what the DMT did with the afterimage.
<p>
	I looked at Christian (one of the people present while I was tripping),
and then closed my eyes. The afterimage was so real that I thought I 
still had my eyes opened. All of a sudden, a small 2 inch square trapdoor
opened up in his forehead, and I could see into his brain. His brain looked
like the red leather of a football (Australian Rules). I knew that the
trapdoor had mechanisms which opened it, and I thought about what mechanisms
(hydraulics, servo motors, whatever) they were. They were not visible, but
I knew where they were and how they worked.
<p>
	Another similar visual also involved Christian. In his afterimage, I saw
his lips and face peel away, exposing his teeth and jaw. A circular metal
ring came out of the back of his neck, crossed the front of his face, and
joined with the other side of his neck. The metal ring was similar to
headgear worn by people with braces on their teeth. His teeth 
then started snapping out at the ring, withdrawing back into his mouth
like Alien.
<p>
	The next time I did this, each of Christian's eyes split into 8, and then
violently bulged out of his head, hanging by their optic nerves, and finally
rested somewhere near his chin.
<p>
	Watching "Dark Star" on video was also quite entertaining. I glanced
at the TV, then closed my eyes. All of the objects on the screen at the time
materialised out of the TV image and fell into a black void that lived 
somewhere near the foot of the TV trolley.

<h2><a name="4">4.      The DMT universe.</a></h2>

(OEVs)
<p>
	Open Eye Visuals at this stage of the trip were too complicated
and too distracting for me. I am unsure of whether I have ever kept
my eyes open during this period. I don't think I could remember anyway.
<p>
(CEVs)
<p>
	As with OEVs, the CEVs at this stage became very difficult to describe
exactly, but I did spend more time in the CEVs when I was at this stage
of a DMT trip. I saw alien beings with elipsoid bodies running around
the insane roads, rooms and corridors that seemed to dominate my visuals.
They were looking at me constantly. I didn't feel threatened by their
presence, I just accepted it and watched them with a curious look.
<p>
	At this stage of the CEVs I had completely forgotten that I had a 
body. My mind had detached itself from it and become a point in virtual
brainspace. My field of vision increased significantly, and I believe the
reason for not being able to remember a majority of these visuals is that
there was just too much information to remember; it was too detailed, too
intense and was arriving at a frightening rate.
<p>
	I have only been at this stage once, and that was during my first
ever psychedelic experience. I intended to place myself here again on 
subsequent trips, but never managed to. All I remember from this stage
is the alien beings, staring at me, examining me, and allowing me to
examine them.
<p>
<h2><a name="5">5.      DMT reality.</a></h2>
<p>
NOTE: I have never reached DMT reality, but I believe I have an idea of what
it may be like for me.
<p>
(OEVs)
<p>
Forget it. I'm not even going to try.
<p>
(CEVs)
<p>
	In the DMT universe, I believe the alien beings exist. I also believe,
and from listening to other people's experiences, that it may be possible
to communicate with them.  I can only imagine the next step past
the DMT universe as DMT reality, where you are freed from your body totally
and allowed to roam freely through your visuals, communicating with the
beings you meet.
<p>
	One person who took DMT twice was asked by a being during her second
trip "Why did you come back? I let you leave last time." Needless to say
this has given her second thoughts about taking DMT again.
<p>
	I find that when I am in the DMT room or universe that
I assume that everyone else in the room knows where I am, and that if
I talk about something that I am seeing then they will instantly
understand. This doesn't happen both ways, of course, so most of the
time I seem like a raving lunatic. I believe it is significant that
I have had "glimpses" of communication with the beings, and with others
in the room, yet on a different level to normal communication. I want
to re-enter the DMT universe and see where I can go from there.
