<blockquote><font size="-1"><strong>Note:</strong> The following text is a transcription of the Constitution in its original form. Items in <strong>bold</strong> hypertext have since been amended or superseded, text in <i>italics</i> is not law. This <a href="../index.html">deoxy.org</a>  edition combines the best features of versions from the <A HREF="http://www.nara.gov/">National Archives and Records Administration</a> (accurate text, constitutional changes linked to their amendments) and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a> (table of contents), with slightly denser hypertext, addition of modern numbers near roman numerals in article and amendment titles, and condensation into one html file.  </font></blockquote><p>

Whenever the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the

Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal
