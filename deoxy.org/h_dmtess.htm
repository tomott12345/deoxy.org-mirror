<strong>DMT EXPERIENCE</strong><br>
A composite essay of my first two DMT trips
<blockquote><img align=right src="gif/ipx_v6.jpg" hspace=37 alt="soalien" hspace=20 vspace=20 border=0 width=64 height=162>
<em>disclaimer: This is a pale reflection of a bottomless 
mystery. The things I say it is, it is now - these are but linguistic 
shrouds I am able to cloak it in. Please don't think you know DMT from 
having read this, you don't. But DO please go and try some, go extract it 
from a plant - then you will KNOW. Oh, this <em>is</em> my experience, you can ask 
me any questions you like. Everything here is with closed eyes unless 
otherwise indicated - this is really the only way to go <strong>DEEP</strong>.</em>

The small wooden pipe was in my mouth and a match was coming to 
light it. The scenario almost seemed like smoking pot except I knew the 
taste to be very wrong as the complex, sweetly acrid smoke filled my 
lungs.  Anyway, my pulse never raced like this from the anticipation of 
getting stoned.  
<p>	The first thing was a sense of dropping away, but to say downward 
would be too simple.  There were all sorts of frequency modulations and 
crescendoed stacatto pops as the trip descended. This sound data was 
quiveringly involved with these visual architectonic dream waters that 
were beginning to emerge, dripping and slipping amongst themselves, and 
my being became overwhelmed by vacuous, gravity-like suction experiences 
which impelled me further in.  Around me I felt a crowding in of beings 
as if the Celtic Faerie land of Fay had become momentarily co-present 
with where I was.  I sensed them, but did not experience these creatures. 
The sucking experience took over for a while then, driving the 
morphological acrobatics of spacelove that lay before me.  There was 
something about it that makes me think of a voluptuous alien seductress 
with big, fat lips pulling me to her body in the weirdest feeling 
embrace  ever.  It felt like I was being smeared sensually and lustfully 
around the space in some sort of vacuum-tube funhouse.  At this point 
(maybe a minute into the experience) I started picking up something like 
the Escher painting of all those sets of stairs with figures descending 
by all manners of gravity, only its surfaces were emerald isles of what I 
can only describe as fractal Medusa liquid, serpentine and sexy. There 
was a thought that I was in a room full of aliens and they were playing 
with me, but that somehow they had conspired to make me this way - the 
alien carney music bar on the planet Tatooine in the Star Wars trilogy 
seems relevant.
<p>  	Then I had the thought (which just seems to pop 
up and not really pertain): "What have I done! How did I get this way?" 
Meaning, how did I come to enter something so foreign that my petty human 
ontological premises and hopeful body of knowledge seem like a wrench 
trying to adjust a camel?  At that point I lost any touch with my body 
and was thrust forward into complete and utter amazement.  The world 
became so crammed full of intricacy to the nth that it seemed every nook 
and cranny in my spacetime was exfoliating little crystalline dancing 
worlds, bellowing ecstasy.  It moved like snakes move: all rippling of 
muscle and sun glinting scales. I cannot emphasize enough the 
catapulting, titanic motions of this iridescent zigzag bottlerocket, this 
nuanced, whittling circus of form, this Brobignagian roller coaster 
safari across the jeweled plains of wonderland, straining the limits of 
the knowable.  
<p>	This is where I was when I felt a certain sort of shockwave 
across the dome of the sky which gave me memory of the real world. I then 
entered this whole journey that I would call extrication. Going in was 
"intrication" or delving into intricacy, so coming back out was sensibly 
extrication.  The experience was very literally an incedible groping back 
out of this wild wooly thing until I made it "out", which afterwards I 
realized was only the physical action of opening my eyes.  The pipe was 
in my mouth - its touching my lips had been the reality shockwave I'd 
felt.  The woman who was handling the pipe for me looked like a fractal 
Medusa as well, but incarnate - she was buzzing all over with this really 
freaky energy.  I said something like, "You expect me to call this a 
mouth?", a comment which was silenced by the stem of the pipe. One toke 
and I was out of my body again, yanked back through the scrim of the 
worlds into the blast furnaces of heaven.  
<p>	I "came to" in some sense at this point and realized that I could 
do anything in a space like this, could instantly unfold my richest 
possible imaginings. "O.K.", I said to myself, "What about trying to do 
what you believe possible by your perceptual theory of higher dimensional 
experience?"  You see, I got the idea that there is no reason why, in an 
inner experience, one has to have visions only in front of one. I began 
to believe this was an imprint that years of bringing the external world 
into construction of inner spaces had created, but was not necessary.  I 
then tried to imagine what it would be like to see in every direction at 
once, i.e. what would a ball look like if you could see every side of it 
at once? I could sense it but not imagine it in my mind. So this is the 
challenge I set myself. It not only seemed to work (though with 
everything else going on inside, it was a bit like trying to do a 
sensitive physics experiment in the midst of a drunken bacchanal) but it 
did so immediately. I rushed upwards into this superspace that was a spun 
galactic ecology of stars, a swarming hive of dragonfly constellations. 
<img align=right src="gif/ipx_v3a.jpg" hspace=8 alt="soalien" hspace=20 vspace=20 border=0 width=125 height=233>
. . This was very profound, but in doing it, it seemed I had reduced the 
alien quality of what had been going on previous to this excursion. 
<p>	I let my will go then and tumbled forward into elfland.  Terence 
McKenna is apt in calling these entities "elves".  They are 
elves/not-elves.  They don't appear, they kind of ooze out of the 
woodwork seductively and before you know it they're there - the whole 
realm is infested with these creatures like nothing else you could ever 
imagine.  They do sing things that are like "self-dribbling jeweled 
basketballs" or whatever you want to call them.  They make Faberge egg 
concoctions with ingredient lists like: 1) space, 2) lust, 3) politics, 
4) circus sideshows, 5) time, 6) gall bladders, 7) existential notions of 
polyfidelity, 8) cucumbers, 9) Beethoven's 5th symphony, 10) the smell of 
petunias, and so on.  This is somewhat of an arbitrary list, but the 
point is, all my categories of mind fell away because they were being 
ceaselessly synthesized and re-synthesized into these hyperdimensional 
objects, undulating, ululating along.  It makes me think of getting home 
from school when your mother says that she's baked you some treats, only 
these are like no treats Mom ever made, and when you see them you almost 
want to say, "Aw, mom, you shouldn't have. I mean you 
<strong>really</strong> shouldn't have".  What you do with these elves 
is some sort of a game of catch, only the physics of the game has been 
replaced by the physics of synesthesia. In catching the things they 
threw, in playing with them, I participated in the ineffable mysteries 
that they were.  This place is the Joycean "Merry go raum". Being there 
I came to understand the Heraclitus fragment: "The Aeon is a child at 
play with colored balls". It is this.  As well I understand, "Still the 
first day, All Fool's Day, here at the center."  It is this too.  
<p>
	So for what seemed like centuries I played with the trippy freaky 
elves and they kept bringing me into atrium after atrium in the antics 
annex, and all I could do was wonder when we would get to their front 
door.  As far as I know, we never did.  Instead they said many things, 
though I can't say they used what we would call a voice to accomplish 
this communication.  I remember only parts of this. At first they said, 
"Build this", indicating hyperspace.  Later they amended this by saying, 
"Build it. He will come." from the movie Field of Dreams. Very funny. 
<p>
	Then it was as though alarms started to go off, and the whole 
space was going through these quivering emergency elaborations.  I get 
the image of a submarine movie sequence when I think back on this, just 
when it has been discovered on the surface, the periscope retracts and 
the whole interior goes into haywire, preparatory gymnastics as all the 
hatches are battened down. There is a phenomenally high-energy dynamic 
associated with this part, as they try to get you out and shut the great 
bronze dancing doors of hyperspace.  It is as if everything is charged 
with imponderable electricities and is racing around because someone 
shouted: "Places everyone!!"  They start cramming your soul out of there 
with a million hands at once, grabbing you by twelve dimensions you never 
knew your body had. Finally, the thing shuts and there is a sense of 
finality to that, but just as soon you are on to the next thing.  
<p>
Slowly then it begins to make farewells and say its goodbyes.  
Ancient mythos holds that the world is supported by turtles "all the way 
down", but as I came out of it, my sense was of jeweled great glass 
revolving elevators all the way down.  I remember thinking that I was 
passing back through the 50,000 veils that the Sufis say the mystery has, 
one by one, and I clearly remember the awe I felt that each one of them 
was closed, sealed, and put away in a unique and voluptuous, succulent 
<img align=right src="gif/ipx_v1.jpg" width=115 height=266 border=0 alt="Hyperspatial Entelechy" hspace=20 vspace=20>
way.  It was without question the most beautiful goodbye I have known in 
this life.  There was no regret of leaving or longing not to leave, just 
an overpowering acceptance of the imminent return.  This went on and upon 
opening my eyes I had this very zap experience and I was right back in 
this world, amazingly enough, only ten minutes gone.  Slight tracers on 
light and then these gone too.  I was amazed of the idea that one could 
go back there, could in fact just go there, that where I had been felt 
entirely like it was a whole hyperspace, raging right next door.  I 
remember saying, and being very sure of this as I still am now, "Those 
are the gods".  By which I meant, of all the things I've experienced in 
life, they are the most like real living gods, and should be called 
that.  It was very interesting to me that I didn't need to process a 
whole lot, which I usually require after the mushrooms.  Instead, I think 
I was in a state of being so existentially surpassed by the quality of 
what I had just been a part of, that I couldn't muster any sort of 
conceptual or descriptive response to it at all.  By default, I was left 
with just a purity of acceptance for it - I just simply had nothing to 
put to it in any sense. Instead I resorted to looking wildly and deeply 
into other peoples eyes and by some existential-perceptual force, to 
impress upon them the utter beauty of what I had just been.  This seemed 
to work somewhat, though probably not.  I definitely felt I had been 
closer to the core of the real than ever before and that this mystery is 
front and center to who we are as humans, who we really  are.  I felt 
very connected to my universe, very sensitive and strong and in touch 
with things.  Because I apparently have the gift of being able to 
remember it quite well (others do not), I have to live with memory of its 
being out there somewhere: very real, very powerful, very alive.  There 
has not been an hour to pass since I did it that I haven't thought of it 
and tried again to reference it to this world, failing.  I do feel it is 
a very important experience to have as a human being, and in some sense a 
whole lot safer than mushrooms or acid. I say this because I am aware 
that I usually have time and opportunity in a traditional trip to come up 
with weird ideas and believe them which can be hell to integrate when 
things return to normal.  DMT seems to be so awe-inspiring, one is just 
so floored by it, that there is no chance for trying to figure it out.

This is left for when you return, spacecraft still steaming.
