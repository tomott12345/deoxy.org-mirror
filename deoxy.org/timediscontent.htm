<p>
The dimension of time seems to be attracting great notice, to judge
from the number of recent movies that focus on it, such as <i>Back to
the Future, Terminator, Peggy Sue Got Married,</i> etc. Stephen
Hawking's <i>A Brief History of Time</i> (1989) was a best-seller and
became, even more surprisingly, a popular film. Remarkable, in
addition to the number of books that deal with time, are the larger
number which don't, really, but which feature the word in their
titles nonetheless, such as Virginia Spate's <i>The Color of Time:
Claude Monet</i> (1992). Such references have to do, albeit indirectly,
with the sudden, panicky awareness of time, the frightening sense
of our being tied to it. Time is increasingly a key manifestation
of the estrangement and humiliation that characterize modern
existence. It illuminates the entire, deformed landscape and will
do so ever more harshly until this landscape and all the forces
that shape it are changed beyond recognizing.
<p>
 This contribution to the subject has little to do with time's
fascination for film-makers or TV producers, or with the current
academic interest in geologic conceptions of time, the history of
clock technology and the sociology of time, or with personal
observations and counsels on its use. Neither aspects nor excesses
of time deserve as much attention as time's inner meaning and
logic. For despite the fact that time's perplexing character has
become, in John Michon's estimation, "almost an intellectual
obsession" (1988), society is plainly incapable of dealing with
it.
<p>
 With time we confront a philosophical enigma, a psychological
mystery, and a puzzle of logic. Not surprisingly, considering the
massive reification involved, some have doubted its existence since
humanity began distinguishing "time itself" from visible and
tangible changes in the world. As Michael Ende (1984) put it:
"There is in the world a great and yet ordinary secret. All of us
are part of it, everyone is aware of it, but very few ever think of
it. Most of us just accept it and never wonder over it. This secret
is time."
<p>
 Just what is "time"? Spengler declared that no one should be
allowed to ask. The physicist Richard Feynman (1988) answered,
"Don't even ask me. It's just too hard to think about."
Empirically as much as in theory, the laboratory is powerless to
reveal the flow of time, since no instrument exists that can
register its passage. But why do we have such a strong sense that
time does pass, ineluctably and in one particular direction, if it
really doesn't? Why does this "illusion" have such a hold over
us? We might just as well ask why alienation has such a hold over
us. The passage of time is intimately familiar, the concept of time
mockingly elusive; why should this appear bizarre, in a world whose
survival depends on the mystification of its most basic categories?
<p>
 We have gone along with the substantiation of time so that it
seems a fact of nature, a power existing in its own right. The
growth of a sense of time&#151;the acceptance of time&#151;is a process of
adaptation to an ever more reified world. It is a constructed
dimension, the most elemental aspect of culture. Time's inexorable
nature provides the ultimate model of domination.
<p>
 The further we go in time the worse it gets. We inhabit an age of
the disintegration of experience, according to Adorno. The pressure
of time, like that of its essential progenitor, division of labor,
fragments and disperses all before it. Uniformity, equivalence,
separation are byproducts of time's harsh force. The intrinsic
beauty and meaning of that fragment of the world that is not-yet-culture moves steadily toward annihilation under a single cultures-wide clock. Paul Ricoeur's assertion (1985) that "we are not
capable of producing a concept of time that is at once
cosmological, biological, historical and individual," fails to
notice how they are converging.
<p>
 Concerning this "fiction" that upholds and accompanies all the
forms of imprisonment, "the world is filled with propaganda
alleging its existence," as Bernard Aaronson (1972) put it so
well. "All awareness," wrote the poet Denise Levertov (1974),
"is an awareness of time," showing just how deeply alienated we
are in time. We have become regimented under its empire, as time
and alienation continue to deepen their intrusion, their debasement
of everyday life. "Does this mean," as David Carr (1988) asks,
"that the 'struggle' of existence is to overcome time itself?" It
may be that exactly this is the last enemy to be overcome.
<p>
 In coming to grips with this ubiquitous yet phantom adversary, it
is somewhat easier to say what time is not. It is not synonymous,
for fairly obvious reasons, with change. Nor is it sequence, or
order of succession. Pavlov's dog, for instance, must have learned
that the sound of the bell was followed by feeding; how else could
it have been conditioned to salivate at that sound? But dogs do not
possess time consciousness, so before and after cannot be said to
constitute time.
<p>
 Somewhat related are inadequate attempts to account for our all
but inescapable sense of time. The neurologist Gooddy (1988),
rather along the lines of Kant, describes it as one of our
"subconscious assumptions about the world." Some have described
it, no more helpfully, as a product of the imagination, and the
philosopher J.J.C. Smart (1980) decided that it is a feeling that
"arises out of metaphysical confusion." McTaggart (1908), F.H.
Bradley (1930), and Dummett (1978) have been among 20th century
thinkers who have decided against the existence of time because of
its logically contradictory features, but it seems fairly plain
that the presence of time has far deeper causes than mere mental
confusion.
<p>
 There is nothing even remotely similar to time. It is as unnatural
and yet as universal as alienation. Chacalos (1988) points out that
the present is a notion just as puzzling and intractable as time
itself. What is the present? We know that it is always now; one is
confined to it, in an important sense, and can experience no other
"part" of time. We speak confidently of other parts, however,
which we call "past" and "future." But whereas things that
exist in space elsewhere than here continue to exist, things that
don't exist now, as Sklar (1992) observes, don't really exist at
all.
<p>
 Time necessarily flows; without its passage there would be no
sense of time. Whatever flows, though, flows with respect to time.
Time therefore flows with respect to itself, which is meaningless
owing to the fact that nothing can flow with respect to itself. No
vocabulary is available for the abstract explication of time apart
from a vocabulary in which time is already presupposed. What is
necessary is to put all the givens into question. Metaphysics, with
a narrowness that division of labor has imposed from its inception,
is too narrow for such a task.
<p>
 What causes time to flow, what is it that moves it toward the
future? Whatever it is, it must be beyond our time, deeper and more
powerful. It must depend as Conly (1975) had it, "upon elemental
forces which are continually in operation."
<p>
 William Spanos (1987) has noted that certain Latin words for
culture not only signify agriculture or domestication, but are
translations from Greek terms for the spatial image of time. We
are, at base, "time-binders", in Alfred Korzybski's lexicon
(1948); the species, due to this characteristic, creates a symbolic
class of life, an artificial world. Time-binding reveals itself in
an "enormous increase in the control over nature." Time becomes
real because it has consequences, and this efficacy has never been
more painfully apparent.
<p>
 Life, in its barest outline, is said to be a journey through time;
that it is a journey through alienation is the most public of
secrets. "No clock strikes for the happy one," says a German
proverb. Passing time, once meaningless, is now the inescapable
beat, restricting and coercing us, mirroring blind authority
itself. Guyau (1890) determined the flow of time to be "the
distinction between what one needs and what one has," and
therefore "the incipience of regret." <i>Carpe diem,</i> the maxim
counsels, but civilization forces us always to mortgage the present
to the future.
<p>
 Time aims continually toward greater strictness of regularity and
universality. Capital's technological world charts its progress by
this, could not exist in its absence. "The importance of time,"
wrote Bertrand Russell (1929), lies "rather in relation to our
desires than in relation to truth." There is a longing that is as
palpable as time has become. The denial of desire can be gauged no
more definitively than via the vast construct we call time.
<p>
 Time, like technology, is never neutral; it is, as Castoriadis
(1991) rightly judged, "always endowed with meaning." Everything
that commentators like Ellul have said about technology, in fact,
applies to time, and more deeply. Both conditions are pervasive,
omnipresent, basic, and in general as taken for granted as
alienation itself. Time, like technology, is not only a determining
fact but also the enveloping element in which divided society
develops. Similarly, it demands that its subjects be painstaking,
"realistic", serious, and above all, devoted to work. It is
autonomous in its overall aspect, like technology; it goes on
forever of its own accord.
<p>
 But like division of labor, which stands behind and sets in motion
time and technology, it is, after all, a socially learned
phenomenon. Humans, and the rest of the world, are synchronized to
time and its technical embodiment, rather than the reverse. Central
to this dimension&#151;as it is to alienation per se&#151;is the feeling of
being a helpless spectator. Every rebel, it follows, also rebels
against time and its relentlessness. Redemption must involve, in a
very fundamental sense, redemption from time.

<h2>Time and the Symbolic World</h2></a>

 "Time is the accident of accidents," according to Epicurus. Upon
closer examination, however, its genesis appears less mysterious.
It has occurred to many, in fact, that notions such as "the
past," "the present," and "the future" are more linguistic
than actual or physical. The neo-Freudian theorist Lacan, for
example, decided that the time experience is essentially an effect
of language. A person with no language would likely have no sense
of the passage of time. <a href="raw.htm">R.A. Wilson</a> (1980), moving much closer to
the point, suggested that language was initiated by the need to
express symbolic time. Gosseth (1972) argued that the system of
tenses found in Indo-European languages developed along with
consciousness of a universal or abstract time. Time and language
are coterminous, decided Derrida (1982): "to be in the one is to
be in the other." Time is a symbolic construct immediately prior,
relatively speaking, to all the others and which requires language
for its actualization.
<p>
 Paul Val&#233;ry (1962) referred to the fall of the species into time
as signalling alienation from nature; "by a sort of abuse, man
creates time," he wrote. In the timeless epoch before this fall,
which constituted the overwhelming majority of our existence as
humans, life, as has often been said, had a rhythm but not a
progression. It was the state when the soul could "gather in the
whole of its being," in Rousseau's words, in the absence of
temporal strictures, "where time is nothing to the soul."
Activities themselves, usually of a leisurely character, were the
points of reference before time and civilization; nature provided
the necessary signals, quite independent of "time". Humanity must
have been conscious of memories and purposes long before any
explicit distinctions were drawn among past, present, and future
(Fraser, 1988). Furthermore, as the linguist Whorf (1956)
estimated, "preliterate ['primitive'] communities, far from being
subrational, may show the human mind functioning on a higher and
more complex plane of rationality than among civilized men."
<p>
 The largely hidden key to the symbolic world is time; indeed it
is at the origin of human symbolic activity. Time thus occasions
the first alienation, the route away from aboriginal richness and
wholeness. "Out of the simultaneity of experience, the event of
Language," says Charles Simic (1971), "is an emergence into
linear time." Researchers such as Zohar (1982) consider faculties
of telepathy and precognition to have been sacrificed for the sake
of evolution into symbolic life. If this sounds far-fetched, the
sober positivist Freud (1932) viewed telepathy as quite possibly
"the original archaic means through which individuals understand
one another." If the perception and apperception of time relate to
the very essence of cultural life (Gurevich 1976), the advent of
this time sense and its concomitant culture represent an
impoverishment, even a disfigurement, by time.
<p>
 The consequences of this intrusion of time, via language, indicate
that the latter is no more innocent, neutral, or assumption-free
than the former. Time is not only, as Kant said, at the foundation
of all our representations, but, by this fact, also at the
foundation of our adaptation to a qualitatively reduced, symbolic
world. Our experience in this world is under an all-pervasive
pressure to be representation, to be almost unconsciously degraded
into symbols and measurements. "Time", wrote the German mystic
Meister Eckhart, "is what keeps the light from reaching us."
<p>
 Time awareness is what empowers us to deal with our environment
symbolically; there is no time apart from this estrangement. It is
by means of progressive symbolization that time becomes
naturalized, becomes a given, is removed from the sphere of
conscious cultural production. "Time becomes human in the measure
to which it becomes actualized in narrative," is another way of
putting it (Ricoeur 1984). The symbolic accretions in this process
constitute a steady throttling of instinctive desire; repression
develops the sense of time unfolding. Immediacy gives way, replaced
by the mediations that make history possible&#151;language in the
forefront.
<p>
 One begins to see past such banalities as "time is an
incomprehensible quality of the given world" (Sebba 1991). Number,
art, religion make their appearances in this "given" world,
disembodied phenomena of reified life. These emerging rites, in
turn, Gurevitch (1964) surmises, lead to "the production of new
symbolic contents, thus encouraging time leaping forward."
Symbols, including time, of course, now have lives of their own, in
this cumulative, interacting progression. David Braine's <i>The
Reality of Time and the Existence of God</i> (1988) is illustrative. It
argues that it is precisely time's reality which proves the
existence of God; civilization's perfect logic.
<p>
 All ritual is an attempt, through symbolism, to return to the
timeless state. Ritual is a gesture of abstraction from that state,
however, a false step that only leads further away. The
"timelessness" of number is part of this trajectory, and contributes 
much to time as a fixed concept. In fact, Blumenberg (1983)
seems largely correct in assaying that "time is not measured as
something that has been present all along; instead it is produced,
for the first time, by measurement." To express time we must, in
some way, quantify it; number is therefore essential. Even where
time has already appeared, a slowly more divided social existence
works toward its progressive reification only by means of number.
The sense of passing time is not keen among tribal peoples, for
example, who do not mark it with calendars or clocks.
<p>
 Time: an original meaning of the word in ancient Greek is
<i>division.</i> Number, when added to time, makes the dividing or
separating that much more potent. The non-civilized often have
considered it "unlucky" to count living creatures, and generally
resist adopting the practice (e.g. Dobrizhoffer 1822). The
intuition for number was far from spontaneous and inevitable, but
"already in early civilizations," Schimmel (1992) reports, "one
feels that numbers are a reality having as it were a magnetic power
field around them." It is not surprising that among ancient
cultures with the strongest emerging senses of time&#151;Egyptian,
Babylonian, Mayan&#151;we see numbers associated with ritual figures and
deities; indeed the Mayans and Babylonians both had number gods
(Barrow 1992).
<p>
 Much later the clock, with its face of numbers, encouraged society
to abstract and quantify the experience of time still further.
Every clock reading is a measurement that joins the clock watcher
to the "flow of time." And we absently delude ourselves that we
know what time is because we know what time it is. If we did away
with clocks, Shallis (1982) reminds us, objective time would also
disappear. More fundamentally, if we did away with specialization
and technology, alienation would be banished.
<p>
 The mathematizing of nature was the basis for the birth of modern
rationalism and science in the West. This had stemmed from demands
for number and measurement in connection with similar teachings
about time, in the service of <a href="korten_index.htm">mercantile capitalism</a>. The continuity
of number and time as a geometrical locus were fundamental to the
Scientific Revolution, which projected <a href="galileoc.htm">Galileo</a>'s dictum to measure
all that is measurable and make measurable that which is not.
Mathematically divisible time is necessary for the conquest of
nature, and for even the rudiments of modern technology.
<p>
 From this point on, number-based symbolic time became crushingly
real, an abstract construction "removed from and even contrary to
every internal and external human experience" (Syzamosi 1986).
Under its pressure, money and language, merchandise and information
have become steadily less distinguishable, and division of labor
more extreme.
<p>
 To symbolize is to express time consciousness, for the symbol
embodies the structure of time (Darby 1982). Clearer still is
Meerloo's formulation: "To understand a symbol and its development
is to grasp human history in a nutshell." The contrast is the life
of the non-civilized, lived in a capacious present that cannot be
reduced to the single moment of the mathematical present. As the
continual now gave way to increasing reliance upon systems of
significant symbols (language, number, art, ritual, myth) dislodged
from the now, the further abstraction, history, began to develop.
Historical time is no more inherent in reality, no less an
imposition on it, than the earlier, less choate forms of time.
<p>
 In a slowly more synthetic context, astronomical observation is
invested with new meanings. Once pursued for its own sake, it comes
to provide the vehicle for scheduling rituals and coordinating the
activities of complex society. With the help of the stars, the year
and its divisions exist as instruments of organizational authority
(Leach 1954). The formation of a calendar is basic to the formation
of a civilization. The calendar was the first symbolic artifact
that regulated social behavior by keeping track of time. And what
is involved is not the control of time but its opposite: enclosure
by time in a world of very real alienation. One recalls that our
word comes from the Latin <i>calends,</i> the first day of the month, when

business accounts had to be settled.
<a name="2">
<h2>Time to Pray, Time to Work</h2></a>

 "No time is entirely present," said the Stoic Chrysippus, and
meanwhile the concept of time was being further advanced by the
underlying <a href="bom.htm">Judeo-Christian</a> tenet of a linear, irreversible path
between creation and salvation. This essentially historical view of
time is the very core of Christianity; all the basic notions of
measurable, one-way time can be found in St. Augustine's (fifth-century) 
writings. With the spread of the new religion the strict
regulation of time, on a practical plane, was needed to help
maintain the discipline of monastic life. Bells summoning the monks
to prayer eight times daily were heard far beyond the confines of
the cloister, and thus a measure of time regulation was imposed on
society at large. The population continued to exhibit "une vaste
indiff&#233;rance au temps" throughout the feudal era, according to
Marc Bloch (1940), but it is no accident that the first public
clocks adorned cathedrals in the West. Worth noting in this regard
is the fact that the calling of precise prayer times became the
chief externalization of medieval Islamic belief.
<p>
 The invention of the mechanical clock was one of the most
important turning points in the history of science and technology;
indeed of all human art and culture (Synge 1959). The improvement
in accuracy presented authority with enhanced opportunities for
oppression. An early devotee of elaborate mechanical clocks, for
example, was Duke Gian Galeazzo Visconti, described in 1381 as "a
sedate but crafty ruler with a great love of order and precision"
(Fraser 1988). As Weizenbaum (1976) wrote, the clock began to
create "literally a new reality...that was and remains an
impoverished version of the old one."
<p>
 A qualitative change was introduced. Even when nothing was
happening, time did not cease to flow. Events, from this era on,
are put into this homogeneous, objectively measured, moving
envelope&#151;and this unilinear progression incited resistance. The
most extreme were the chiliast, or millenarian, movements, which
appeared in various parts of Europe from the 14th into the 17th
centuries. These generally took the form of peasant risings which
aimed at recreating the primal egalitarian state of nature and were
explicitly opposed to historical time. These utopian explosions
were quelled, but remnants of earlier time concepts persisted as a
"lower" stratum of folk consciousness in many areas.
<p>
 During the Renaissance, domination by time reached a new level as
public clocks now tolled all twenty-four hours of the day and added
new hands to mark the passing seconds. A keen sense of time's all-consuming 
presence is the great discovery of the age, and nothing
portrays this more graphically than the figure of Father Time.
Renaissance art fused the Greek god <a href="gaia/goddess.htm#CRONUS">Kronos</a> with the Roman god
<a href="gaia/goddess.htm#SATURN">Saturn</a> to form the familiar grim deity representing the power of
Time, armed with a fatal scythe signifying his association with
agriculture/domestication. <i>The Dance of Death</i> and other medieval
<i>memento mori</i> artifacts preceded Father Time, but the subject is now
time rather than death.
<p>
 The seventeenth century was the first in which people thought of
themselves as inhabiting a particular century. One now needed to
take one's bearings within time. Francis Bacon's <i>The Masculine
Birth of Time</i> (1603) and <i>A Discourse Concerning a New Planet</i> (1605)
embraced the deepening dimension and revealed how a heightened
sense of time could serve the new scientific spirit. "To choose
time is to save time," he wrote, and "Truth is the daughter of
time." Descartes followed, introducing the idea of time as
limitless. He was one of the first advocates of the modern idea of
progress, closely related to that of unbounded linear time, and
characteristically expressing itself in his famous invitation that
we become "masters and possessors of nature."
<p>
 Newton's clockwork universe was the crowning achievement of the
Scientific Revolution in the seventeenth century, and was grounded
in his conception of "Absolute, true and mathematical time, of
itself and from its own nature, flowing equably without relation to
anything eternal." Time is now the grand ruler, answering to no
one, influenced by nothing, completely independent of the
environment: the model of unassailable authority and perfect
guarantor of unchanging alienation. Classical Newtonian physics in
fact remains, despite changes in science, the dominant, everyday
conception of time.
<p>
 The appearance of independent, abstract time found its parallel
in the emergence of a growing, formally free working class forced
to sell its labor power as an abstract commodity on the market.
Prior to the coming of the factory system but already subject to
time's disciplinary power, this labor force was the inverse of the
monarch Time: free and independent in name only. In Foucault's
judgment (1973), the West had become a "carceral society" from
this point on. Perhaps more directly to the point is the Balkan
proverb, "A clock is a lock."
<p>
 In 1749 Rousseau threw away his watch, a symbolic rejection of
modern science and civilization. Somewhat more in the dominant
spirit of the age, however, were the gifts of fifty-one watches to
Marie Antoinette upon her engagement. The word is certainly
appropriate, as people had to "watch" the time more and more;
watches would soon become one of the first consumer durables of the
industrial era.
<p>
 William Blake and Goethe both attacked Newton, the symbol of the
new time and science, for his distancing of life from the sensual,
his reduction of the natural to the measurable. Capitalist
ideologue <a href="korten_betrayal.htm">Adam Smith</a>, on the other hand, echoed and extended
Newton, by calling for greater rationalization and routinization.
Smith, like Newton, labored under the spell of an increasingly
powerful and remorseless time in promoting further division of
labor as objective and absolute progress.
<p>
 The Puritans had proclaimed waste of time the first and in
principle the deadliest of sins (Weber 1921); this became, about a
century later, Ben Franklin's "Time is money." The factory system
was initiated by clockmakers and the clock was the symbol and
fountainhead of the order, discipline and repression required to
create an industrial proletariat.
<p>
 Hegel's grand system in the early 19th century heralded the "push
into time" that is History's momentum; time is our "destiny and
necessity," he declared. Postone (1993) noted that the
"progress" of abstract time is closely tied to the "progress"
of capitalism as a way of life. Waves of industrialism drowned the
resistance of the Luddites; appraising this general period, Lyotard
(1988) decided that "the illness of time was now incurable."
<p>
 An increasingly complex class society requires an ever larger
array of time signals. Fights against time, as Thompson (1967) and
Hohn (1984) have pointed out, gave way to struggles over time;
resistance to being yoked to time and its inherent demands was
defeated in general, replaced, typically, by disputes over the fair
determination of time schedules or <a href="zerowork.htm">the length of the work day</a>. (In
an address to the First International (July 28, 1868), Karl Marx
advocated, by the way, age nine as the time to begin work.)
<p>
 The clock descended from the cathedral, to court and courthouse,
next to the bank and railway station, and finally to the wrist and
pocket of each decent citizen. Time had to become more
"democratic" in order to truly colonize subjectivity. The
subjection of outer nature, as Adorno and others have understood,
is successful only in the measure of the conquest of inner nature.
The unleashing of the forces of production, to put it another way,
depended on time's victory in its long-waged war on freer
consciousness. Industrialism brought with it a more complete
commodification of time, time in its most predatory form yet. It
was this that Giddens (1981) saw as "the key to the deepest
transformations of day-to-day social life that are brought about by
the emergence of capitalism."
<p>
 "Time marches on," as the saying goes, in a world increasingly
dependent on time and a time increasingly unified. A single giant
clock hangs over the world and dominates. It pervades all; in its
court there is no appeal. The standardization of world time marks
a victory for the efficient/machine society, a universalism that
undoes particularity as surely as computers lead to homogenization
of thought.
<p>
 Paul Virilio (1986) has gone so far as to foresee that "the loss
of material space leads to the government of nothing but time." A
further provocative notion posits a reversal of the birth of
history out of maturing time. Virilio (1991), in fact, finds us
already living within a system of technological temporality where
history has been eclipsed. "...the primary question becomes less
one of relations to history than one of relations to time."
<p>
 Such theoretical flights aside, however, there is ample evidence
and testimony as to time's central role in society. In "Time&#151;The
Next Source of Competitive Advantage" (July-August, 1988 <i>Harvard
Business Review),</i> George Stark, Jr. discusses it as pivotal in the
positioning of capital: "As a strategic weapon, time is the
equivalent of money, productivity, quality, even innovation." Time
management is certainly not confined to the corporations; Levine's
1985 study of publicly accessible clocks in six countries
demonstrated that their accuracy was an exact gauge of the relative
industrialization of national life. Paul Adler's January-February,
1993 <i>Harvard Business Review</i> offering, "Time-and-Motion
Regained," nakedly champions the neo-Taylorist standardization and
regimentation of work: behind the well-publicized "workplace
democracy" window dressing in some factories remains the "time-and-motion 
discipline and formal bureaucratic structures essential
for efficiency and quality in routine operations."

<a name="3">
<h2>Time in Literature</h2></a>

 It is clear that the advent of writing facilitated the fixation
of time concepts and the beginning of history. But as the
anthropologist Goody (1991) points out, "oral cultures are often
only too prepared to accept these innovations." They have already
been conditioned, after all, by language itself. McLuhan (1962)
discussed how the coming of the printed book, and mass literacy,
reinforced the logic of linear time.
<p>
 Life was steadily forced to adapt. "For now hath time made me his
numbering clock," wrote Shakespeare in <i>Richard II.</i> "Time", like
"rich", was one of the favorite words of the Bard, a time-haunted
figure. A hundred years later, Defoe's <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> reflected
how little escape from time seemed possible. Marooned on a desert
island, Crusoe is deeply concerned with the passage of time;
keeping close track of his affairs, even in such a setting, meant
above all keeping track of the time, especially as long as his pen
and ink lasted.
<p>
 Northrop Frye (1950) saw the "alliance of time and Western man"
as the defining characteristic of the novel. Ian Watt's <i>The Rise of
the Novel</i> (1957) likewise focused on the new concern with time that
stimulated the novel's emergence in the eighteenth century. As
Jonathan Swift told it in <i>Gulliver's Travels</i> (1726), his protagonist 
never did anything without looking at his watch. "He called
it his oracle, and said it pointed out the time for every action of
his life." The Lilliputians concluded that the watch was
Gulliver's god. Sterne's <i>Tristram Shandy</i> (1760), on the eve of the
Industrial Revolution, begins with the mother of Tristram
interrupting his father at the moment of their monthly coitus:
"'Pray, my dear,' quoth my mother, 'have you not forgot to wind
up the clock?'"
<p>
 In the nineteenth century Poe satirized the authority of clocks,
linking them to bourgeois superficiality and obsession with order.
Time is the real subject of Flaubert's novels, according to Hauser
(1956), as Walter Pater (1901) sought in literature the "wholly
concrete moment" which would "absorb past and future in an
intense consciousness of the present," similar to Joyce's
celebration of "epiphanies". In <i>Marius the Epicurean</i> (1909),
Pater depicts Marius suddenly realizing "the possibility of a real
world beyond time." Meanwhile Swinburne looked for a respite beyond 
"time-stricken lands" and Baudelaire declared his fear and
hatred of chronological time, the devouring foe.
<p>
 The disorientation of an age wracked by time and subject to the
acceleration of history has led modern writers to deal with time
from new and extreme points of view. Proust delineated
interrelationships among events that transcended conventional
temporal order and thus violated Newtonian conceptions of
causation. His thirteen-volume <i>A la Recherche du Temps Perdu</i>
(1925), usually rendered in English as <i>Remembrance of Things Past,</i>
is more literally and accurately translated as <i>Searching for Lost
Time.</i> In it he judges that "a minute freed from the order of time
has recreated in us...the individual freed from the order of
time," and recognizes "the only environment in which one could
live and enjoy the essence of things, that is to say, entirely
outside time."
<p>
 Philosophy in the twentieth century has been largely preoccupied
with time. Consider the misguided attempts to locate authentic time
by thinkers as different as Bergson and Heidegger, or the latter's
virtual deification of time. A.A. Mendilow's <i>Time and the Novel</i>
(1952) reveals how the same intense interest has dominated the
novels of the century, in particular those of Joyce, Woolf, Conrad,
James, Gide, Mann, and of course, Proust. Other studies, such as
<i>Church's Time and Reality</i> (1962), have expanded this list of
novelists to include, among others, Kafka, Sartre, Faulkner, and
Vonnegut.
<p>
 And of course time-struck literature cannot be confined to the
novel. T.S. Eliot's poetry often expressed a yearning to escape
time-bound, time-ridden conventionality. <i>"Burnt Norton"</i> (1941) is
a good example, with these lines:
<p><blockquote>
  Time past and time future
  Allow but a little consciousness.
  To be conscious is not to be in time.
</blockquote><p>
 Samuel Beckett, early in his career (1931), wrote pointedly of
"the poisonous ingenuity of Time in the science of affliction."
The play <i>Waiting for Godot</i> (1955) is an obvious candidate in this
regard, and so is his <i>Murphy</i> (1957), in which time becomes
reversible in the mind of the main character. When the clock may go
either way, our sense of time, and time itself, vanishes.

<a name="4">
<h2>The Psychology of Time</h2></a>

 Turning to what is commonly called psychology, we again come upon
one of the most fundamental questions: Is there really a phenomenon
of time that exists apart from any individual, or does it reside
only in one's perceptions of it? Husserl, for example, failed to
show why consciousness in the modern world seems to inevitably
constitute itself in time. We know that experiences, like events of
every other kind, are neither past, present nor future in
themselves.
<p>
 Whereas there was little sociological interest in time until the
1970s, the number of studies of time in the literature of
psychology has increased rapidly since 1930 (Lauer 1988). Time is
perhaps hardest of all to define "psychologically". What is time?
What is the experience of time? What is alienation? What is the
experience of alienation? If the latter subject were not so
neglected the obvious interrelationship would be made clear.
<p>
 Davies (1977) termed time's passage "a psychological phenomenon
of mysterious origin" and concluded (1983), "the secret of mind
will only be solved when we understand the secret of time." Given
the artificial separation of the individual from society, which
defines their field, it is inevitable that such psychologists and
psychoanalysts as Eissler (1955), Loewald (1962), Namnum (1972),
and Morris (1983) have encountered "great difficulties" in
studying time!
<p>
 At least a few partial insights have been achieved, however.
Hartcollis (1983), for instance, noted that time is not only an
abstraction but a feeling, while Korzybski (1948) had already taken
this further with his observation that "'time' is a feeling,
produced by conditions of this world...." In all our lives we are
"waiting for Godot," according to Arlow (1986), who believed that
our experience of time arises out of unfulfilled emotional needs.
Similarly, Reichenbach (1956) had termed anti-time philosophies,
like religion, "documents of emotional dissatisfaction." In
Freudian terms, Bergler and Roheim (1946) saw the passage of time
as symbolizing separation periods originating in early infancy.
"The calendar is an ultimate materialization of separation
anxiety." If informed by a critical interest in the social and
historical context, the implications of these undeveloped points
could become serious contributions. Confined to psychology,
however, they remain limited and even misleading.
<p>
 In the world of alienation no adult can contrive or decree the
freedom from time that the child habitually enjoys&#151;and must be made
to lose. Time training, the essence of schooling, is vitally
important to society. This training, as Fraser (1984) very cogently
puts it, "bears in almost paradigmatic form the features of a
civilizing process." A patient of Joost Meerlo (1966) "expressed
it sarcastically: 'Time is civilization,' by which she meant that
scheduling and meticulousness were the great weapons used by adults
to force the youngsters into submission and servility." Piaget's
studies (1946, 1952) could detect no innate sense of time. Rather,
the abstract notion of "time" is of considerable difficulty to
the young. It is not something they learn automatically; there is
no spontaneous orientation toward time (Hermelin and O'Connor 1971,
Voyat 1977).
<p>
 Time and tidy are related etymologically, and our Newtonian idea
of time represents perfect and universal ordering. The cumulative
weight of this ever more pervasive pressure shows up in the
increasing number of patients with time anxiety symptoms (Lawson
1990). Dooley (1941) referred to "the observed fact that people
who are obsessive in character, whatever their type of neurosis,
are those who make most extensive use of the sense of time...."
Pettit's <i>"Anality and Time"</i> (1969) argued convincingly for the
close connection between the two, as Meerloo (1966), citing the
character and achievements of Mussolini and Eichmann, found "a
definite connection between time compulsion and fascistic
aggression."
<p>
 Capek (1961) called time "a huge and chronic hallucination of the
human mind"; there are few experiences indeed that can be said to
be timeless. Orgasm, LSD, a life "flashing before one's eyes" in
a moment of extreme danger...these are some of the rare, evanescent
situations intense enough to escape from time's insistence.
<p>
 Timelessness is the ideal of pleasure, wrote Marcuse (1955). The
passage of time, on the other hand, fosters the forgetting of what
was and what can be. It is the enemy of eros and deep ally of the
order of repression. The mental processes of the unconscious are in
fact timeless, decided Freud (1920). "...time does not change them
in any way and the idea of time cannot be applied to them." Thus
desire is already outside of time. As Freud said in 1932: "There
is nothing in the Id that corresponds to the notion of time; there
is no recognition of the passage of time."
<p>
 Marie Bonaparte (1939) argued that time becomes ever more plastic
and obedient to the pleasure principle insofar as we loosen the
bonds of full ego control. Dreams are a form of thinking among 
non-civilized peoples (Kracke 1987); this faculty must have once been
much more accessible to us. The Surrealists believed that reality
could be much more fully understood if we could make the connection
to our instinctive, subconscious experiences; Breton (1924), for
example, proclaimed the radical goal of a resolution of dream and
conscious reality.
<p>
 When we dream the sense of time is virtually nonexistent, replaced
by a sensation of presentness. It should come as no surprise that
dreams, which ignore the rules of time, would attract the notice of
those searching for liberatory clues, or that the unconscious, with
its "storms of impulse" (Stern 1977), frightens those with a
stake in the neurosis we call civilization. Norman O. Brown (1959)
saw the sense of time or history as a function of repression; if
repression were abolished, he reasoned, we would be released from
time. Similarly, Coleridge (1801) recognized in the man of
"methodical industry" the origin and creator of time.
<p>
 In his <i>Critique of Cynical Reason</i> (1987), Peter Sloterdijk called
for the "radical recognition of the Id without reservation," a
narcissistic self-affirmation that would laugh in the face of
morose society. Narcissism has of course traditionally been cast as
wicked, the "heresy of self-love." In reality that meant it was
reserved for the ruling classes, while all others (workers, women,
slaves) had to practice submission and self-effacement (Fine 1986).
The narcissist symptoms are feelings of emptiness, unreality,
alienation, life as no more than a succession of moments,
accompanied by a longing for powerful autonomy and self-esteem
(Alford 1988, Grunberger 1979). Given the appropriateness of these
"symptoms" and desires it is little wonder that narcissism can be
seen as a potentially emancipatory force (Zweig 1980). Its demand
for total satisfaction is obviously a subversive individualism, at
a minimum.
<p>
 The narcissist "hates time, denies time" (letter to author,
Alford 1993) and this, as always, provokes a severe reaction from
the defenders of time and authority. Psychiatrist E. Mark Stern
(1977), for instance: "Since time begins beyond one's control one
must correspond to its demands.... Courage is the antithesis of
narcissism." This condition, which certainly may include negative
aspects, contains the germ of a different reality principle, aiming
at the non-time of perfection wherein being and becoming are one
and including, implicitly, a halt to time.

<h2>Time in Science</h2></a>

<blockquote>
I'm not a scientist but I do know that all things begin and end in
eternity. <font size="-1"><i>&#151;The Man Who Fell to Earth,</i> Walter Tevis</font>
</blockquote><p>
 Science, for our purposes, does not comment on time and
estrangement with anywhere near the directness of, say, psychology.
But science can be re-construed to shed light on the topic at hand,
because of the many parallels between scientific theory and human
affairs.
<p>
"Time," decided N.A. Kozyrev (1971), "is the most important and
the most mysterious phenomenon of Nature. Its notion is beyond the
grasp of imagination." Some scientists, in fact, have felt (e.g.
Dingle 1966) that "all the real problems associated with the
notion of time are independent of physics." Science, and physics
in particular, may indeed not have the last word; it is another
source of commentary, however, though itself alienated and
generally indirect.
<p>
 Is "physical time" the same as the time of which we are
conscious; if not, how does it differ? In physics, time seems to be
an undefined basic dimension, as much a taken-for-granted given as
it is outside the realm of science. This is one way to remind
ourselves that, as with every other kind of thinking, scientific
ideas are meaningless outside their cultural context. They are
symptoms of and symbol for the ways of living that give rise to
them. According to Nietzsche, all writing is inherently
metaphorical, even though science is rarely looked at this way.
Science has developed by drawing an increasingly sharp separation
between inner and outer worlds, between dream and "reality". This
has been accomplished by the mathematization of nature, which has
largely meant that the scientist proceeds by a method that debars
him or her from the larger context, including the origins and
significance of his/her projects. Nonetheless, as H.P. Robinson
(1964) stated, "the cosmologies which humanity has set up at
various times and in various localities inevitably reflect the
physical and intellectual environment, including above all the
interests and culture of each society."
<p>
 Subjective time, as P.C.W. Davies pointed out (1981), "possesses
apparent qualities that are absent from the 'outside' world and
which are fundamental to our conception of reality"&#151;principally
the "passing" of time. Our sense of separation from the world
owes largely to this discrepancy. We exist in time (and
alienation), but time is not found in the physical world. The time
variable, though useful to science, is a theoretical construct.
"The laws of science," Stephen Hawking (1988) explained, "do not
distinguish between past and future." Einstein had gone further
than this some thirty years earlier; in one of his last letters, he
wrote that "People like us, who believe in physics, know that the
distinction between past, present and future is only a stubborn,
persistent illusion." But science partakes of society in other
ways concerning time, and very deeply. The more "rational" it
becomes, the more variations in time are suppressed. Theoretical
physics geometrizes time by conceiving it as a straight line, for
example. Science does not stand apart form the cultural history of
time.
<p>
 As implied above, however, physics does not contain the idea of
a present instant of time that passes (Park 1972). Furthermore, the
fundamental laws are not only completely reversible as to the
"arrow of time"&#151;as Hawking noted&#151;but "irreversible phenomena
appear as the result of the particular nature of our human
cognition," according to Watanabe (1953). Once again we find human
experience playing a decisive role, even in this most "objective"
realm. Zee (1992) put it this way: "Time is that one concept in
physics we can't talk about without dragging in, at some level,
consciousness."
<p>
 Even in seemingly straightforward areas ambiguities exist where
time is concerned. While the complexity of the most complex species
may increase, for example, not all species become more complex,
prompting J.M. Smith (1972) to conclude that it is "difficult to
say whether evolution as a whole has a direction."
<p>
 In terms of the cosmos, it is argued, "time's arrow" is
automatically indicated by the fact that the galaxies are receding
away from each other. But there seems to be virtual unanimity that
as far as the basics of physics are concerned, the "flow" of time
is irrelevant and makes no sense; fundamental physical laws are
completely neutral with regard to the direction of time (Mehlberg
1961, 1971, Landsberg 1982, Squires 1986, Watanabe 1953, 1956,
Swinburne 1986, Morris 1984, Mallove 1987, D'Espagnant 1989, etc.).
Modern physics even provides scenarios in which time ceases to
exist and, in reverse, comes into existence. So why is our world
asymmetric in time? Why can't it go backward as well as forward?
This is a paradox, inasmuch as the individual molecular dynamics
are all reversible. The main point, to which I will return later,
is that time's arrow reveals itself as complexity develops, in
striking parallel with the social world.
<p>
 The flow of time manifests itself in the context of future and
past, and they in turn depend on a referent known as the now. With
Einstein and relativity, it is clear that there is no universal
present: we cannot say it is "now" throughout the universe. There
is no fixed interval at all that is independent of the system to
which it refers, just as alienation is dependent on its context.
<p>
 Time is thus robbed of the autonomy and objectivity it enjoyed in
the Newtonian world. It is definitely more individually delineated,
in Einstein's revelations, than the absolute and universal monarch
it had been. Time is relative to specific conditions and varies
according to such factors as speed and gravitation. But if time has
become more "decentralized", it has also colonized subjectivity
more than ever before. As time and alienation have become the rule
throughout the world, there is little solace in knowing that they
are dependent on varying circumstances. The relief comes in acting
on this understanding; it is the invariance of alienation that
causes the Newtonian model of independently flowing time to hold
sway within us, long after its theoretical foundations were
eliminated by relativity.
<p>
 Quantum theory, dealing with the smallest parts of the universe,
is known as the fundamental theory of matter. The core of quantum
theory follows other fundamental physical theories, like
relativity, in making no distinction in the direction of time
(Coveny and Highfield 1990). A basic premise is indeterminism, in
which the movement of particles at this level is a matter of
probabilities. Along with such elements as positrons, which can be
regarded as electrons moving backward in time, and tachyons,
faster-than-light particles that generate effects and contexts
reversing the temporal order (Gribbin 1979, Lindley 1993), quantum
physics has raised fundamental questions about time and causality.
In the quantum microworld common acausal relationships have been
discovered that transcend time and put into question the very
notion of the ordering of events in time. There can be
"connections and correlations between very distant events in the
absence of any intermediary force or signal" which occur
instantaneously (Zohar 1982, Aspect 1982). The eminent American
physicist John Wheeler has called attention (1977, 1980, 1986) to
phenomena in which action taken now affects the course of events
that have already happened.
<p>
 Gleick (1992) summed up the situation as follows: "With
simultaneity gone, sequentiality was foundering, causality was
under pressure, and scientists generally felt themselves free to
consider temporal possibilities that would have seemed far-fetched
a generation before." At least one approach in quantum physics has
attempted to remove the notion of time altogether (J.G. Taylor
1972); D. Park (1972), for instance, said, "I prefer the atemporal
representation to the temporal one."
<p>
 The bewildering situation in science finds its match in the
extremity of the social world. Alienation, like time, produces ever
greater oddities and pressures: the most fundamental questions
finally, almost necessarily, emerge in both cases.
<p>
 St. Augustine's fifth century complaint was that he didn't
understand what the measurement of time really consisted of.
Einstein, admitting the inadequacy of his comment, often defined
time as "what a clock measures." Quantum physics, for its part,
posits the inseparability of measurer and what is measured. Via a
process physicists don't claim to understand fully, the act of
observation or measurement not only reveals a particle's condition
but actually determines it (Pagels 1983). This has prompted Wheeler
(1984) to ask, "Is everything&#151;including time&#151;built from
nothingness by acts of observer-participancy?" Again a striking
parallel, for alienation, at every level and from its origin,
requires exactly such participation, virtually as a matter of
definition.
<p>
 Time's arrow&#151;irrevocable, one-direction-only time&#151;is the monster
that has proven itself more terrifying than any physical
projectile. Directionless time is not time at all, and Cambel
(1993) identifies time directionality as "a primary characteristic
of complex systems." The time-reversible behavior of atomic
particles is "generally commuted into behavior of the system that
is irreversible," concluded Schlegel (1961). If not rooted in the
micro world, where does time come from? Where does our time-bound
world come from? It is here that we encounter a provocative
analogy. The small scale world described by physics, with its
mysterious change into the macro world of complex systems, is
analogous to the "primitive" social world and the origins of
division of labor, leading to complex, class-divided society with
its apparently irreversible "progress".
<p>
 A generally held tenet of physical theory is that the arrow of
time is dependent on the Second Law of Thermodynamics (e.g.
Reichenbach 1956), which asserts that all systems tend toward ever
greater disorder or entropy. The past is thus more orderly than the
future. Some proponents of the Second Law (e.g. Boltzmann 1866)
have found in entropic increase the very meaning of the past-future
distinction.
<p>
 This general principle of irreversibility was developed in the
middle decades of the 19th century, beginning with Carnot in 1824,
when industrial capitalism itself reached its apparent non-reversible 
point. If evolution was the century's optimistic
application of irreversible time, the Second Law of Thermodynamics
was its pessimistic one. In its original terms, it pictured a
universe as an enormous heat engine running down, where work became
increasingly subject to inefficiency and disorder. But nature, as
Toda (1978) noticed, is not an engine, does not work, and is not
concerned with "order" or "disorder". The cultural aspect of
this theory&#151;namely, capital's fear for its future&#151;is hard to miss.
<p>
 One hundred and fifty years later, theoretical physicists realize
that the Second Law and its supposed explanation of the arrow of
time cannot be considered a solved problem (N=82eman 1982). Many
supporters of reversible time in nature consider the Second Law too
superficial, a secondary law not a primary one (e.g. Haken 1988,
Penrose 1989). Others (e.g. Sklar 1985) find the very concept of
entropy ill-defined and problematic, and, related to the charge of
superficiality, it is argued that the phenomena described by the
Second Law can be ascribed to particular initial conditions and do
not represent the workings of a general principle (Davies 1981,
Barrow 1991). Furthermore, not every pair of events that bear the
"afterward" relation the one to the other bear an entropic
difference. The science of complexity (with a wider scope than
chaos theory) has discovered that not all systems tend toward
disorder (Lewin 1992), also contrary to the Second Law. Moreover,
isolated systems, in which no exchanges with the environment are
allowed, display the Second Law's irreversible trend; even the
universe may not be such a closed system. Sklar (1974) points out
that we don't know whether the total entropy of the universe is
increasing, decreasing, or remaining stationary.
<p>
 Despite such aporias and objections, a movement toward an
"irreversible physics" based on the Second Law is underway, with
quite interesting implications. 1977 Nobel Laureate Ilya Prigogine
seems to be the most tireless and public advocate of the view that
there is an innate unidirectional time at all levels of existence.
Whereas the fundamentals of every major scientific theory, as
noted, are neutral with respect to time, Prigogine gives time a
primary emphasis in the universe. Irreversibility is for him and
his like-minded fellow believers an over-arching primal axiom. In
supposedly nonpartisan science, the question of time has clearly
become a political matter.
<p>
 Prigogine (1985), in a symposium sponsored by Honda and promoting
such projects as Artificial Intelligence: "Questions such as the
origin of life, the origin of the universe, or the origin of
matter, can no longer be discussed without recourse to
irreversibility." It is no coincidence that non-scientist Alvin
Toffler, America's leading cheerleader for a high-tech world,
provided an enthusiastic forward for one of the basic texts of the
pro-time campaign, Prigogine and Stenger's <i>Order Out of Chaos</i>
(1984). Prigogine disciple Ervin Laszlo, in a bid to legitimate and
extend the dogma of universally irreversible time, asks whether the
laws of nature are applicable to the human world. He soon answers,
in effect, his own disingenuous question (1985): "The general
irreversibility of technological innovation overrides the
indeterminacy of individual points of bifurcation and drives the
processes of history in the observed direction from primitive
tribes to modern techno-industrial states." How "scientific"!
This transposition from the "laws of nature" to the social world
could hardly be improved on as a description of time, division of
labor, and the mega-machine crushing the autonomy or
"reversibility" of human decision. Leggett (1987) expressed this
perfectly: "So it would seem that the arrow of time which appears
in the apparently impersonal subject of thermodynamics is intimately 
related to what we, as human agents, can or cannot do."
<p>
 It is deliverance from "chaos" which Prigogine and others promise 
 the ruling system, using the model of irreversible time.
Capital has always reigned in fear of entropy or disorder.
Resistance, especially resistance to work, is the real entropy,
which time, history, and progress constantly seek to banish.
Prigogine and Stenger (1984) wrote: "Irreversibility is either
true on all levels or none." All or nothing, always the ultimate
stakes of the game.
<p>
 Since civilization subjugated humanity we have had to live with
the melancholy idea that our highest aspirations are perhaps
impossible in a world of steadily mounting time. The more that
pleasure and understanding are deferred, moved out of reach&#151;and
this is the essence of civilization&#151;the more palpable is the
dimension of time. Nostalgia for the past, fascination with the
idea of time travel, and the heated quest for increased longevity
are some of the symptoms of time sickness, and there seems to be no
ready cure. "What does not elapse in time is the lapse of time
itself," as Merleau-Ponty (1945) realized.
<p>
 In addition to the general antipathy at large, however, it is
possible to point out some recent specifics of opposition. The
Society for the Retardation of Time was established in 1990 and has
a few hundred members in four European countries. Less whimsical
than it may sound, its members are committed to reversing the
contemporary acceleration of time in everyday life, toward the aim
of being allowed to live more satisfying lives. Michael
Theunissen's <i>Negative Theology of Time</i> appeared in 1991, aimed
explicitly at what it sees as the ultimate human enemy. This work
has engendered a very lively debate in philosophical circles (Penta
1993), due to its demand for a negative reconsideration of time.
<p>
 "Time is the one single movement appropriate to itself in all its
parts," wrote Merleau-Ponty (1962). Here we see the fullness of
alienation in the separated world of capital. Time is thought of by
us before its parts; it thus reveals the totality. The crisis of
time is the crisis of the whole. Its triumph, apparently well
established, was in fact never complete as long as anyone could
question the first premises of its being.
<p>
 Above Lake Silviplana, Nietzsche found the inspiration for <i>Thus
Spake Zarathustra.</i> "Six thousand feet above men and time...," he
wrote in his journal. But time cannot be transcended by means of a
lofty contempt for humanity, because overcoming the alienation that
it generates is not a solitary project. In this sense I prefer
Rexroth's (1968) formulation: "the only Absolute is the Community
of Love with which Time ends."
<p>
 Can we put an end to time? Its movement can be seen as the master
and measure of a social existence that has become increasingly
empty and technicized. Averse to all that is spontaneous and
immediate, time more and more clearly reveals its bond with
alienation. The scope of our project of renewal must include the
entire length of this joint domination. Divided life will be
replaced by the possibility of living completely and wholly&#151;timelessly&#151;only 
when we erase the primary causes of that division.
