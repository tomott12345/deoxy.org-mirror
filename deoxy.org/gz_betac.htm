<h1>Three Beta-Carboline Containing Plants As Potentiators of
Synthetic DMT and Other Indole Psychedelics</h1>
<b>a technical note from the underground by <i>Gracie and Zarkov</i></b>
<p>
<b>WARNING:</b>
This paper is aimed at the <i>serious</i> student and/or researcher of psychedelic
substances. Unlike many of our more popularly oriented articles and papers we
<i>do not</i> intend it for our recreationally inclined friends on the psychedelic
underground. Given the diets and drug habits of most contemporary "heads",
the use of MAO inhibitors could easily result in <b>serious physical
complications (LIKE DEATH).</b> Additionally, these states are <i>so intense</i> that
unless you are <i>crazy</i> enough to regard 50mg of DMT or 7.5 grams of potent stropharia mushrooms as the beginning of a good time, these mixes are definitely <b>NOT FOR YOU.</b>
<p>
The content of this technical note will, we hope, provide researchers
interested in the beta-carboline/tryptamine combinations with some "hard
empirical facts" combined with our musings. Hopefully, these will spawn new
ideas for further experiments in this very exciting and very confusing area
of psychedelic research.

<h2>SUMMARY</h2>

The purpose of this paper is to summarize our current work with three beta-
carboline, Harmala alkaloid-containing plants, i.e.,
<pre>
    Passiflora incarnata (passion flower)
    Peganum harmala (syrian rue)
    Banisteriopsis caapi (principal ingredient in yage)
</pre>
Specifically, we wish to report on the phenomena and comparitive activity
when extracts of each of these plants are smoked in conjunction with DMT.

<h2>SOURCES OF THE PLANT MATERIAL</h2>

  The passion flower was purchased as dried, whole, chopped plant material
from an herb store. The seeds of the syrian rue were purchased from a
specialty seed service. No attempt was made to ascertain the origin of the
plant material. The Banisteriopsis caapi was obtained from a private
plantation in Hawaii. The caapi arrived cut into lengths of about one foot
long, and ranged in diameter from about one quarter of an inch to one half
inch. The original plant specimens had been collected in the Amazon by the
grower.

<h2>EXTRACTION TECHNIQUES</h2>

  We used the same extraction technique for all three plants. We had
developed this technique for smoking the passion flower to potentiate
Psilocybin mushrooms (see below) and wished to have the data from this set
of expriments to be comparable. The technique was a two-stage extraction.
The first extraction used was a boiling alcohol (we used vodka) and water
infusion followed by a second extraction using boiled distilled water. Each
infusion was boiled for several hours. A "slow cooker" is ideal for this.
In the case of the caapi, the bark was peeled off in strips first. For the
syrian rue, we first ground the seeds very fine. For both the passion flower
and the caapi, the second extract was essentially clear and seemed
unnecessary. However, in the case of the syrian rue, the second extract
was a bright cloudy yellow which may indicate harmine in solution.
<p>
  The plant material was strained and compressed after each extraction. The
liquids from the from the two extractions were combined and dried using low
heat on the slow cooker. The result was a brown caramally mass for both the
passion flower and the caapi. The weight was about 20% of the original for
the passion flower and the rue, and about 45% for the caapi. Except in the
case of the passion flower, we cannot see any clear advantages of extraction
over that of smoking the original plant material due to the relatively minor
concentration of the amount needed to smoke. A plain water infusion would
also seem to be just as effective in removing the harmine and would result in
less of the other plant components being extracted.
<p>
  The syrian rue extract was the most interesting. It actually had long,
thin, yellowish crystals in a brownish, red, hard, clear matrix which was not
at all gooey like the other two extracts. This is not surprising given the
assumed concentration of beta-carboline alkaloids. Based on our rough
averaging from a variety of sources, our up-front beta-carboline
concentration estimates for the plant materials were as follows:
<pre>
Plant               % beta-carbolines       Ratio (Syrian rue=1)
-----               -----------------       --------------------
Rue                      2.0%  - 4.0%               1
Caapi                    0.1%                      20
Passion flower           0.05% - 0.1%              40
</pre>

<h2>USAGE</h2>

  In each case we smoked the extract until we had reached subjectively the
same high. As with our previous work with the passion flower extract, smoking
significant amounts above this did not seem to get one any higher, but just
intensified the physical symptoms and one felt increasingly sick. So far,
only with the passion flower have we experimented with an oral dose. Oral
infusions of the other plants are planned for our fall 1985 series of
experiments.
<p>
  The plant material is smoked with a match, lighter or torch in such a way
to promote the boiling of the material, rather than burning it. This seems to
yield the most effective high. The highly concentrated rue extract lends
itself nicely to smoking in a "hash oil" pipe with the flame heating the bowl
on the outside.

<h2>THE HIGH</h2>

The high is not particularly psychedelic or hallucinogenic. One feels calm.
This calming effect is particularly noted by an observer as a significant
change in facial expression and tone of voice. The limbs become heavy and
lethargic and visibly tremble. Hypersalivation occurs, particularly at the
back of the mouth, making for a particularly smooth smoke. A slight
irritation of urethra and anus is sometimes reported. At higher dosages,
dizziness and nausea sets in with very little increase in the high. Closed
eye imagery is at best hypnagogic. That is to say, faint, moving outlines can
be discerned with closed eyes. If one has a particularly vivid imagination,
ghostly outlines of figures can be discerned. The more literal minded just
see shifting blobs of light and dark. No one who has experienced DMT or high
dose mushrooms would ever call them visions.
<p>
  The high comes on and stabilizes after about 5 to 10 minutes from smoking.
As mentioned before, it is very difficult to get higher by smoking more. If
one stops at this point, the most noticable thing would be a calm and
unapprehensive state. We take particular note of this diminishing of
apprehensions since we are always apprehensive before we smoke DMT so its
dimunition or absence is very noticable.
<p>
  The passion flower is mentally the foggiest high, but curiously has the
strongest "antidepresant" effect. This may be related to the overall mix of
alkaloids in the passion flower (see below). The syrian rue was the clearest,
cleanest high with the caapi being, subjectively in between. The caapi had
the least "antidepressant" effect.
<p>
  Sage ratios of the original plant material smoked for subjectively reaching
the same level of high is roughly estimated as follows:
<pre>
    Plant               Dosage Ratio
    -----               ------------
    Rue                      1
    Caapi                   12
    Passion flower          20
</pre>
  The dosage ratio is based on the mass of the original plant material. That
is to say, to get as high as smoking one ounce of syrian rue, would require
smoking 12 onces of caapi, or over two kilograms of passion flower.
<p>
  Curiously, although various field researchers estimate beta-carboline
dosage in native brews to range between 300 to 500mg, in our dosage we only
needed dosages in the 50mg range. As noted above, increasing the dosage did
not increase the high but only aggravated the physical symptoms. Even when
tryptamines were taken later in addition, increasing the dosage past this
point did not significantly alter the combined trip. It was as if there was
some "switch" in the brain which, with sufficient beta-carbolines, was set
from "off" to "on" and no further action could take place. We do not rule out
the possibility of a second 'switch' as the 300-500mg range that we might
have missed.

<h2>TRYPTAMINE COMBINATIONS</h2>

For comparison purposes, each of the plant materials was smoked according to
the above method. Approximately 10 minutes after this plant-material-high
stabilized, 15mg of DMT was smoked. One of us would go through the entire
procedure while the other kept notes and timings.
<p>
The following consistent effects were observed:
<ul>
<li>The overall impact of the trip was heightened far above the normally only
threshold effects of a 15mg dose of DMT. Subjectively, the dose felt more
like 35-45mg or roughly tripled in intensity.
<p>
<li>The overall length of the DMT 'flash' and subsequent patterns was
lengthened. The 'flash' of visions which is normally 2 to 3 minutes at a 40mg
dosage, was about 6 minutes with the beta-carboline predosing at 15mg of DMT.
The total period of intense closed eye imagery, normally less than 5 to 7
minutes (including the flash) was extended uniformly to about 9 minutes with
an additional 10 minute slowly decreasing tail of closed eye patterns.
<p>
<li>The auditory effects were so pronounced as to be almost overwhelming on
several occasions. In fact, the auditory effects were stronger than even
extremely high dose trips where we had smoked 50 to 70mg of DMT all at once.
The initial sounds, the so-called 'carrier wave' or opening buzz that has
been described as 'tearing plastic' was greatly amplified. The DMT 'music'
which we describe as a xylophone-type sound which accompanies the visions was
extremely loud and seemed to keep coming on to the point where it became
disturbing on several trips.
<p>
<li>The basic 'jeweled dome' or 'chrysanthemum' pattern, seen after the 'vision
flash' was fractured or separated. Instead of a uniform circular pattern,
there seemed to be distinctive left and right halves of the pattern with a
new, hard to describe pattern in the middle. The overall effect of the
patterns seemed to us more mushroom-like, although we would be hard pressed
to give a detailed explaination of why we felt this way.
<p>
<li>Similarly, the visions seemed to unfold in a more leisurely fashion. Again,
we were reminded of the mushroom. While the DMT effect still hits fast and
hard, the rushed 'million things at once' feeling of DMT smoked alone is
quite muted.
<p>
<li>The colors of the pattern are also shifted as compard to DMT alone. Again,
since we can't accurately describe colors in the first place, it is hard to
pin down, but it could be characterized as less primary or jewel-like, with
fewer or less saturated colors than DMT alone.
<p>
<li>Finally, when one comes out of the vision state, the 'woozey' feeling is
quite pronounced for an additional 10 minutes or so. This feeling was very
reminicent of the mushroom 'knock-down'.
</ul>

<p>
  The content of the visions was also altered. There were fewer "alien, self-
transforming, elf-machines" and more visions of recognizable things. Strange
animals and hooded figures marched on a bas relief procession. Griffin-like
monsters rhythmically changed into beautiful naked women and back. The
feeling tone was serious, unlike the playfulness or cheerful even though
quite terrifying hilarity of the "self-transforming elf machines" experienced
on DMT alone. The intensity was altered. We hesitate to say increase, since
DMT is intense by itself, but the change in feeling tone, the more serious,
almost personally directed information of the trance, subjectively made the
trip more intense. On one trip, one of us made ocntact with a highly serious,
palpable entity whose message could be quite simply summarized as "Are you
sure you want to get into this? This is far more extreme than what you have
done before. It is the path to destruction of gnosis!"
<p>
  Subjectivelly, we preferred the syrian rue to potentiate DMT. It gave the
cleanest, most intense high. While we have never taken true Ayahuasca,
detailed discussion of some of the trip's contents with someone who has
significant experience with that brew, confirmed that the trip content was
like a short ayahuasca trip.
<p>
  The passion flower was the least desirable potentiator. (Probably due to
low harmine content in proportion to the total bet-carboline content.) The
amount needed for effective tryptamine potentiation left us foggy and
somewhat sick. Furthermore the MAO effects lingered for two to three days.
The caapi's effects were, again, in between.

<h2>Anomalous Observations</h2>

  This brings us to a curious set of observations. First, although the
literature would indicate that the harmine MAO inhibition should be reversed
in about five hours, the effects from all of the smoked plant material
continued for at least 24 to 48 hours. That is to say, clear potentiation was
noticed after this amount of time had elapsed. We hypothesize that this
effect is due primarily to beta-carbolines other than harmine present in the
plant material which, while qualitatively weaker as MAO inhibitors, may have
a duration of effect which is much longer. However, we have reason to believe
that something additional, due to tryptamines, may be happening.
<p>
  Once we had taken 7.5 grams of very potent dried Stropharia. We were
interested in making contact with the 'voice in the head' phenomenon. We
potentiated the mushrooms by each smoking about 750 grams (!) of passion
flower (reduced as described above) starting about 30 minutes after eating
the mushrooms. The potentiation was quite overwhelming. After smoking about
one quarter of the plant material, each fresh lungful brought on, within
seconds, powerful "starburst" and "intersecting lightning bolt"
hallucinations which, with eyes opened, obscured a well-lit room. The voice
phenomenon was loud and clear and very unsettling (the content of the trip
has been described in High Frontiers, Issue 2). Before the trip we had
attempted on several occasions to invoke the voice phenomenon with the same
mushrooms at dosages of up to 10 grams, to no avail. But, even more
curiously, effects such as clear instance of MAO inhibition, voices in the
head, visions (with both closed and opened eyes) and finally at the end of
the period, clear potentiation of another psychedelic (LSD) occurred at
discrete short intervals over a period of 14 days! We realize that this
sounds unbelievable, however it did happen. It is our opinion that particular
long-term effects can be initiated by large combined doses of tyrptamines and
beta-carbolines that cannot be adequately explained using current models of
brain chemistry.
<p>
  Additionally, since that rather harrowing trip, the mushroom "voice" has
been inescapable even on dosages as low as approximately one gram. As less
spectacular long-term effects, we have also noticed this "locking in" or
tuning-in effect with the beta-carboline/DMT combination. That is, effects
that were previously elusive on DMT alone became easy to invoke once they
have occurred in the combination.
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> We understand from conversations with other investigators that this
approach of first taking the mushrooms and then smoking the beta-carboline
material when mushroom effects begin to come on to be the most efficacious
approach.
<p>
  Another curious observation is the "9 minute barrier". So far, we have not
been successful in causing the DMT imagery to last longer than 9 minutes,
irrespective of the dosage, or the type of underlying predose plant material.
To make matters more interesting in our experiments with DMT and MDA (which
is also a mild MAO inhibitor) the DMT effects are again lengthened to about 9
minutes. Yet ayahuasca produces a trip which lasts for several hours. At
present we have no explaination, especially since much of the active
components in the orally consumed brews are inactivated in the stomach and
intestines or not absorbed.
<p>
  In experiments in which we have predosed ourselves with DMT and then taken
another psychedelic several hour later, we have noted very discernible (MDA)
to dramatic (mushrooms or LSD) effects when the second substance is taken as
much as 8 hours after the DMT. Again, this is hard to explain since the
total DMT experience should only last about one hour. However, when we smoked
DMT and after the flash smoked the beta-carboline plant material we were
unable to cause any clear DMT imagery. What did happen was an immediate
feeling of depression, almost exactly opposite the effect on mood of DMT.
<p>
  One final hard-to-explain phenomenon. On about one quarter of the trips,
after coming out of the trance and with our condition stabilized (or at least
so we felt) about 20 minutes after smoking DMT, we experienced a rush of
"information" into our minds with no other psychedelic effects. That is to
say, without any visual, physical or auditory shift, we suddenly possessed,
in our minds, a complex, detailed and lengthy thought with no idea where it
had come from and the conviction that it had not existed in our heads, even
in fragments, an instant before. The content of each of these thoughts was
bizarre and had to do with directions on how to accomplish activities that
are normally regarded as supernatural, impossible and/or crazy. Furthermore,
the content of the thought was encouraging us to attempt these feats! While
we have no first hand experience with schizophrenics (other than some
Berkeley street people) our reading of the literature caused us to conclude
that this type of phenomenon would be considered a clear instance of
schizophrenic thinking.

<h2>Beta-Carbolone Potentiation of LSD</h2>

  We have also experimented with potentiation of LSD by beta-carboline
containing plants. Generically, the effects follow the same patterns.
Subjectively, the dose feels three to four times more potent than it actually
is. The closed eye imagery is greatly enhanced with circular highly visible
bright imagery visible on only 25 [sic] micrograms. On higher doses
(150-200 micrograms) there was a feeling of an ancestral presence (we have
never felt an outside presence on LSD alone in over several hundred acid
trips but we have found it quite common when LSD is combined with another
psychedelic).
<p>
  The closed-eye patterns were "almost visions". That is to say they were
clearer than hypnagogic imagery but not as overwhelming or clear as DMT
visions. The visuals were more like clear dream imagery. The mood elevation
was quite astounding. At one point one of us shouted "You couldn't possibly
have a bad trip on this stuff." There were no mood swings and the buoyant
elation slowly receded to baseline over the course of the trip. 

<h2>Tentative Conclusions and Suggestions for Further Research</h2>

  To restate the obvious, indole psychedelics taken in a state of MAO
inhibition are much more intense and <i>qualitatively different</i> than when
taken alone. We believe that these combinations offer numerous fruitful
avenues for further research.
<p>
  Additionally, we find the syrian rue seeds to be a convenient, concentrated
and easily obtainable source of beta-carbolines that can serve as a
substitute for the more exotic, difficult to obtain, <i>Banisteriopsis caapi.</i>
<p>
  Clearly, our next area of research should be in the area of "synthetic
Ayahuasca". That is, trying to perfect an orally administered mixture of
syrian rue and synthetic DMT that qualitatively behaves like the South
American plant brews.
<p>
  Additional work should be done with the smoked mixtures to investigate the
"9 minute barrier" and to provide more qualitative mixtures for some future
beta-carboline/tryptamine cookbook.
<p>
  Finally, we hope that the information in this article might be correlated
with the work of other researchers to suggest entirely new areas for research
and to provide explainations for some of these phenomena.
