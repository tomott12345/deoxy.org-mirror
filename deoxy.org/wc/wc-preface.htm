<h2>Preface</h2><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The material in <a href="bookinfo.htm">this book</a> was compiled by the Commission of Inquiry for the International War Crimes Tribunal. Most of the material in the first part of the book was originally presented at the first hearings of the Commission of Inquiry in New York City on May 11, 1991. More than 1,000 people attended the hearings held at Stuyvesant Auditorium. Since the announcement of the formation of the Commission of Inquiry, organizations world-wide have come foreward to participate and to offer evidence and testimony. A few selections of this additional testimony from other Commission hearings have been included where space permits. Commissions of Inquiry have been established in fifteen countries around the world, and public hearings where new testimony was presented were held in twenty-eight cities in the U.S. Obviously a great deal of this valuable material could not be presented in the short confines of this book.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At the May 11, 1991 hearing in New York, former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark outlined <a href="wc-crime.htm">the 19-point indictment</a> of the U.S. government's conduct in the Gulf War that served as the basis of the Commission's work. For seven hours eyewitnesses who had traveled to Iraq during and following the war presented evidence on the extensive and deliberate destruction of Iraq's infrastructure.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Compelling video testimony was shown. Images of destroyed neighborhoods, shrapnel and burn victims, dehydrated and undernourished children in hospitals lacking electricity and necessary drugs were diplayed in the photo exhibit. Some of these photos are also included in this book.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Commission of Inquiry for an International War Crimes Tribunal was initiated by Ramsey Clark and the Coalition to Stop U.S. Intervention in the Middle East following Mr. Clark's February trip to Iraq. Accompanied by a video filmmaker and a photgrapher, Mr. Clark traveled 2,000 miles through Iraq during a time when the U.S. was running up to 3,000 bombing sorties a day. He first documented the systematic destruction of the civilian infrastructure, a view later confirmed by a number of other delegations and even by the United Nation's own team of investigators. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Commission of Inquiry was established to gather testimony and evidence on an international basis and to present the testimony in a series of public hearings. Evidence gathered at all these hearings is to be presented to an International Tribunal of Judges on February 27, 2, and 29, 1992 in New York--the one-year anniversary of the war.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This book contains in the Appendix the information detailing the extent for the destruction that Ramsey Clark originally presented in a letter to then United Nations Secretary General Javier P&eacute;rez de Cu&eacute;llar and President George Bush and released to the world press. Other eyewitness reports and <a href="wc-appa.htm">passages from several of the international laws and conventions</a> along with U.S. Representative Henry Gonzalez's Resolution of Impeachment of President Bush on the basis of violations of the U.S. Constitution, the United Nations Charter and international laws have also been included.
