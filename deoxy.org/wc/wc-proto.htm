<h2>PART IV: CIVILIAN POPULATION</h2>
<h3>Section 1: General Protection Against Effects of Hostilities</h3>
<h4>Chapter I: Basic Rule and Field of Application</h4>
<h5>Article 48: Basic Rule</h5>
	In order to ensure respect for and protection of the civilian population and civilian objects, the Parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives.

<h5>Article 49: Definition of Attacks and Scope of Application</h5>
<ol>
<li>"Attacks" means acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offense or in defense.

<li> The provisions of this Section apply to any land, air or sea warfare which may affect the civilian population, individual civilians or civilian objects on land. They further apply to all attacks from the sea or from the air against objectives on land but do not otherwise affect the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict at sea or in the air.
<li> The provisions of this Section are additional to the rules concerning humanitarian protection contained in the Fourth Convention, particularly in Part II thereof, and in other international agreements binding upon the High Contracting Parties, as well as to other rules of international law relating to the protection of civilians and civilian objects on land, at sea or in the air against the effects of hostilities.
</ol>
<h4>Chapter II: Civilians and Civilian Population</h4>

<h5>Article 50: Definition of Civilians and Civilian Population</h5>
<ol>
<li>A civilian is any person who does not belong to one of the categories of persons referred to in Article 4 A 111, lIl, (31 and 161 of the Third Convention and in Article 43 of this Protocol. In case of doubt whether a person is a civilian, that person shall be considered to be a civilian.
<li>The civilian population comprises all persons who are civilians.
<li>The presence within the civilian population of individuals who do not come within the definition of civilians does not deprive the population of its civilian character.
</ol>
<h5><a name="a51">Article 51: Protection of the Civilian Population</a></h5>
<ol>
<li>The civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against dangers arising from military operations. To give effect to this protection, the following rules, which are additional to other applicable rules of international law, shall be observed in all circumstances.
<li>The civilian population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack. Acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited.
<li>Civilians shall enjoy the protection afforded by this Section, unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.
<li><a name="51.4">Indiscriminate attacks are prohibited. Indiscriminate attacks are:</a>
<ol type=a>
<li>those which are not directed at a specific military objective;
<li>those which employ a method or means of combat which cannot be directed at a specific military objective; or
<li>those which employ a method or means of combat the effects of which cannot be limited as required by this Protocol; and consequently, in each such case, are of a nature to strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects without distinction.
</ol>
<li>Among others, the following types of attacks are to be considered as indiscriminate:
<ol type=a>
<li>an attack by bombardment by any methods or means which treats as a single military objective a number of clearly separated and distinct military objectives located in a city, town, village or other area containing a similar concentration of civilians or civilian objects; and
<li>an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.
</ol>
<li>Attacks against the civilian population or civilians by way of reprisals are prohibited.
<li>The presence or movements of the civilian population or individual civilians shall not be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations, in particular in attempts to shield military objectives from attacks or to shield, favor or impede military operations. The Parties to the conflict shall not direct the movement of the civilian population or individual civilians in order to attempt to shield military objectives from attacks or to shield military operations.
<li>Any violation of these prohibitions shall not release the Parties to the conflict from their legal obligations with respect to the civilian population and civilians, including the obligation to take the precautionary measures provided for in <a href="wc-proto.htm#a57">Article 57</a>.
</ol>
<h4>Chapter III: Civilian Objects</h4>

<h5>Article 52: General Protection of Civilian Objects</h5>

<li><a name="a52p2">Attacks shall be limited strictly to military objectives</a>. In so far as objects are concerned, military objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.
<li>In case of doubt whether an object which is normally dedicated to civilian purposes, such as a place of worship, a house or other dwelling or a school, is being used to make an effective contribution to military action, it shall be presumed not to be so used.

<li>It is prohibited to attack, destroy, remove or render useless objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies and irrigation works, for the specific purpose of denying them for their sustenance value to the civilian population or to the adverse Party, whatever the motive, whether in order to starve out civilians, to cause them to move away, or for any other motive.
<li>The prohibitions in paragraph 2 shall not apply to such of the objects covered by it as are used by an adverse Party:
<ol type=a>
<li>as sustenance solely for the members of its armed forces; or
<li>if not as sustenance, then in direct support of military action, provided, however, that in no event shall actions against these objects be taken which may be expected to leave the civilian population with such inadequate food or water as to cause its starvation or force its movement.
</ol>
<li>These objects shall not be made the object of reprisals.
<li>In recognition of the vital requirements of any Party to the conflict in the defense of its national territory against invasion, derogation from the prohibitions contained in paragraph 2 may be made by a Party to the conflict within such territory under its own control where required by imperative military necessity.
</ol>
<h5>Article 55: Protection of the Natural Environment</h5>
<ol>
<li>Care shall be taken in warfare to protect the natural environment against widespread, long-term and severe damage.

</ol>
<h5><a name="56">
Article 56: Protection of Works and Installations Containing Dangerous Forces</a></h5>
<ol>
<li>Works or installations containing dangerous forces, namely dams, dikes and nuclear electrical generating stations, shall not be made the object of attack, even where these objects are military objectives, if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population. Other military objectives located at or in the vicinity of these works or installations shall not be made the object of attack if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces from the works or installations and consequent severe losses among the civilian population.
<li>The special protection against attack provided by paragraph I shall cease:
<ol type=a>
<li>for a dam or a dike only if it is used for other than its normal function and in regular, significant and direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support;
<li>for a nuclear electrical generating station only if it provides electric power in regular, significant and direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support;
<li>for other military objectives located at or in the vicinity of these works or installations only if they are used in regular, significant and direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support.
</ol>
<li>In all cases, the civilian population and individual civilians shall remain entitled to all the protection accorded them by international law, including the protection of the precautionary measures provided for in <a href="wc-proto.htm#a57">Article 57</a>.

<li>It is prohibited to make any of the works, installations or military objectives mentioned in paragraph 1 the object of reprisals.
<li>The Parties to the conflict shall endeavor to avoid locating any military objectives in the vicinity of the works or installations mentioned in paragraph 1. Nevertheless, installations erected for the sole purpose of defending the protected works or installations from attack are permissible and shall not themselves be made the object of attack, provided that they are not used in hostilities except for defensive actions necessary to respond to attacks against the protected works or installations and that their armament is limited to weapons capable only of repelling hostile action against the protected works or installations.
<li>The High Contracting Parties and the Parties to the conflict are urged to conclude further agreements among themselves to provide additional protection for objects containing dangerous forces.
<li>In order to facilitate the identification of the objects protected by this Article, the Parties to the conflict may mark them with a special sign consisting of a group of three bright orange circles placed on the same axis, as specified in Article 16 of Annex I to this Protocol. The absence of such marking in no way relieves any Party to the conflict of its obligations under this Article.
