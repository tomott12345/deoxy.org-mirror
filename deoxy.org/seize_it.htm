SEIZING THE MEDIA is a work in progress. The version that you are holding
 is the second to circulate. As Immediast thinking and strategy develops,
 this leaflet will grow and change, and new versions will circulate.
<p align=justify>
 IMMEDIAST projects are against all forms of coercive communication,
 cultural monologue and media control. We acknowledge non-violent public
 insurgence as a legitimate response to sustained violations by media and
 state. We recognize the air as public property, and the signals that
 travel through it to be the domain of the public.

<h3>Seizing the Media</h3></a>

    Asian philosophy instructs enlightenment. But given our daily exposure
to a barrage of persuasive messages, monologues, sales pitches, come-ons,
and uninformative hyper-sensational news, common sense and intimacy are
tough enough a struggle to maintain.
<p>
    We can each see how extended exposure to television and mass media
dulls people with a sense of numbness and nausea. From every public space
a monologue of coercion penetrates our senses and rapes our attention.
Wherever we look, wherever we listen, wherever we go: the pornography of
billboards, bus side placards, subway cards, glaring storefront signs and
displays, the glut of junk mail, stupid fly-by beach planes and blimps,
coupons, obnoxious bumper stickers and breast pins, embarrassing service
forms, plastic banners and ribbons, absurd parades, street-corner handouts,
windsheild wiper flyers, matchbook ads, business cards, screaming radios,
the daily papers, every nanosecond of television, the package wrapped
around everything we buy&#151;from the label in our underwear to the robot
computer that calls us in our homes&#151;only the upper atmosphere and the
ocean floor offer any sanctuary from America's ecology of coercion. At
every turn the monologues drone on, imbedding the <a href="memelex.htm">psychological mutagens</a>
that coax us to become pathetic customers and unquestioning flag wavers.
At every turn we are under subtle attack.
<p>
    The media serve the interests of the State and other corporations,
but never the interests of the public. The media's screen of aggression
and seduction is designed to mesmerize and captivate the largest possible
sector of population whose attention is then sold like scrap metal to
advertisers and gang raped by their slogans, jingles, and manic images.
Protected by an uncrossable media moat, agents of the State profit from
war and relax behind a web of information laws, censorship powers, and
vapid explanations that swat the public of detailed intelligence and mass
resistance.
<p>
    So long as we do not control our own government, our own state, and our
own broadcast media&#151;the mirror with which we reflect on the reality of
lives&#151;we will continue to be forced to see fun-house mirror distortions
of ourselves projected onto a dumpster of products that promise to make us
each desirable, sophisticated, and correct. At every turn we are under
attack.
<a href="seize_it.htm#top" name=p2>
<h3>Incest Of Corporations And The State</h3></a>

    The State controls information, debt, and violence and targets
<b>collective identity.</b> Corporations control commodification, work, and
media and target <b>individual identity.</b> Both deploy the same psychological
strategies for embedding the public with their messages and directives.
Never were their common strategies more transparent than when US
disinformation and propaganga service, the infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USIA" target=_blank>USIA</a>, decided to
step-up its psy-warfare campaign against the people of Cuba in the Spring
of 1989. Until then, attempts to psychologically destabalize the Cuban
people were concentrated in the broadcasts of <a href="http://www.martinoticias.com/radio.asp" target=_blank>Radio Marti</a>, the Florida
based, Government owned pirate radio station that to this day illegally
transmits propaganda and disinformation into domestic Cuban radios. In
the Spring of 1989, the USIA added images to their psy-war arsenal and
began transmitting tele-broadcasts from a hot air balloon controlled from
the Key West signals station. Sibling of Radio Marti, the project was
dubbed <a href="http://www.martinoticias.com/tv.asp" target=_blank>TV Marti</a>.
<p>
    A few things are to be held in mind here. First, after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creel_Commission" target=_blank>Creel
Commission</a> saturated Americans with pro-war propaganda during WWI, the
level of public disgust was so intense that laws were enacted forbidding
the State from ever subjecting the public to its propaganda again. Thus,
the USIA's <a href="http://www.voanews.com/" target=_blank>Voice of America</a> propaganda broadcasts that we can hear today
in Amsterdam, Berlin, and Prague, we are protected against hearing here
on our own turf. Propaganda is so disorienting and confusing that Americans
have actually passed laws forbidding it here in its crude verifiable forms. 
<p>
    The fact that we must now face and destroy is that advertising,
entertainment, and news have become the government's Trojan Horse into the
psyche of the public. What was TV Marti's first propaganda broadcast aimed
at the minds of the Cuban people? <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ca3/antimusicindustry/MTVSucks.html" target=_blank>MTV</a>. Think about it: The 
USIA's first
broadcast of tele-propaganda delivered MTV's corporate rock videos! At
every turn we are under attack.

---------------------------------       -----------------------------
1. Representation is reality.           1. Representation is reality.
2. Secrecy is security.                 2. Ownership is identity.
3. Violence empowers the violent.       3. To consume is to connect.

</pre>
The Assault Of Spectacle Media is twofold: <b>while immersing the public in
a barrage of coercive messages, commercial media serves as an accomplice
to political felony, murder, and treason by censoring the details and
dimensions of State activity from democratic processes and public
intelligence.</b> Culture, awareness, and democratic power are what we
surrender for an internal economy that is dependent on the relentless
preparation and sale of public attention for penetration by corporate and
State advertising. The Immediasts stand in solidarity with all groups and
individuals who act in opposition to this situation and whose work assists
omnicultural vocality, public production libraries, public media and an
open state.
<a href="seize_it.htm#top" name=p3>
<h3>Methods of Mind Control</h3></a>

    Immediast research has turned up two invaluable sources revealing
State tactics of behavior modification, subliminal manipulation, and
mind control. The first is the <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/cia/guerilla.htm" target=_blank>Psychological Warfare Manual</a> authored
and  distributed by the <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8085945499556832271" target=_blank title="Secrets of the CIA, 44min.">CIA</a> 
to the Nicaraugan terrorists, the Contras.
The instruction manual directives state:
<blockquote>
   In effect, the human being should be considered the priority
   objective in a political war. And conceived as the military
   target of guerrilla war, the human being has its most critical
   point in his mind. Once his mind has been reached, the "political
   animal" has been defeated, without necessarily receiving bullets...

<p>   This conception of guerrilla warfare as political war turns
   Psychological Operations into the decisive factor of the results.
   The target, then, is the minds of the population, all the population:
   our troops, the enemy troops and the civilian population...

<p>   Communication is a way to ask and give the answer to the same question.
</blockquote>

<p>    The manual goes on to instruct its readers how to effectively deceive,
blackmail, and assasinate individuals antagonistic to the imperatives of
the State.
<p>
    Our second source of documentation exposing State led programs of
media subversion is found in the video documentaries and published articles
of Fred Landis. Landis first discovered the presence of mind control
tactics in commercial broadcast media by monitoring daily newspapers
produced by the CIA in Chile in 1973. His resulting Ph.D dissertation
outlined CIA tactics of subliminal manipulation and mind control and was
used against the CIA in Volume 7 of the 1975 Hearings of the Senate Church
Committee; "The CIA and the Media," and in the 1977-1978 Hearings of the
House Intelligence Committee. Landis' observations and research exposed a
now easily identifiable method deployed by the State to psychologically
destabilize and subliminally coerce a given population. Based on the cross-
cultural linguistic theory and research generated by Charles Osgood (funded
by the CIA), the government deploys the following method, called Semantic
Differential:
<p><ul>
    <li> First, media agents identify cultural symbols which have deep
     emotional associations within a target population's everyday
     domestic, cultural, and spiritual lives. Agents then use these
     symbols as in-roads to the people's unconscious and manipulate
     these symbols as subliminal imbeds which can be antagonized or
     resonated in accordance with situations being manufactured by
     the CIA. "Indirect attacks on government ministers employ the
     juxtaposition of photos of the targeted official with unrelated
     headlines, subliminal propaganda, and pre-selected word
     associations. By simply placing the key word near a photo of
     government leaders, a crude behaviorist attempt is made to
     condition new associations and new values to familiar
     personalities."
<p>
    <li> "The combined effect of word associations (derived from the
     semantic differential) with subliminal imbeds is so strong that
     it displaces any other message"&#151;even ones which disprove the
     connotations and meaning of the effect.
</ul>

<p>    State tactics of media control deliver subliminal and disinforming
directives in the guise of news. Targeting deep psychological imbeds
present in every culture, the State instills shock, terror, confusion,
sexual arousal, awe or uncertainty by antagonizing or coupling these
imbeds with sensational headlines associating such things as Satanism
with enemies, and religious miracles and good luck with leaders implanted
or puppetted by the State. The symbols change from culture to culture.
During the US Supreme Court Nomination Hearings of Clarence Thomas, the
New York Times ran a cover photo (Sunday 13 October 1991) of Senator
Hatch holding up a copy of The Exorcist and associating it with Anita
Hill! This was not an accusation, it was a psychological tactic. According
to the semantic differential, the deep and negative feelings experienced
in people by such associations outlast evidence which demonstrates their
falsehood and perversion.

<h3>Immediast Tactics</h3></a>

    Asian philosophy instructs self-realization and awakening, but when
under attack, Asian philosophy also instructs methods for overpowering
an assailant with the force of his own assault. We herald this approach.
Immediast tactics aim to neutralize the key images and text being imbedded
into the public by the media and the State. Our work is the liberation
of public space from the broadcasts of corporations, businesses, and
departments of the State; and the abolition of public captivity as
spectators to the ceaseless barrage of billboards, manipulative images,
State constructed news and propaganda. The question is, how we can
lockjaw the spectacle with its own force?
<p>
    Returning all airborne commercial broadcast media to public direction,
access, and control will naturally release cultural forces difficult at
present to imagine&#151;the mind turned inside out won't be a viral
image slogan on a Gannet billboard, it will be living people on the
airwaves and in the streets.
<p>
   <b>We interpret <i>Freedom of Speech</i> to mean the facilitated ability to
both access and produce information and cultural material through the
development of public production libraries where we can each and all
produce cultural print, radio, television, and radio broadcast materials
in library studios equipped with desktop publishing facilities, graphics
technology, multi-track audio recorders, film and video cameras, and
editing equipment.</b> Freedom to broadcast can be in the power of the public.
<u>Corporations can be evicted from the airwaves.</u> We can charge them staggering
rent for the low-end frequencies if we want to. The State, under relentless
public scrutiny, can be kept nude of its power to hide from, indebt, and
subvert the public. Democracy can be as open and dynamic as our public
libraries.
<p>
    Of course we anticipate struggle on the part of the State and
corporations. Let them struggle, doing so opens up new fissures and points
of access. In the meantime, we call on you to engage in your own actions.
We call on artists, writers, posterists, activists, and  networkers from
all countries to assist with our project. Vocalize your disgust. Speak up.
Fight back. Liberate the public spaces in the zones that most need it&#151;the ones in your everyday life. Organize Networker Congresses. Strike.
Send to our journal, Noospapers, your statements, manifestoes, critiques,
tracts, tactics, poetry, posters, collages, documentation, graphics and
art. Together we can begin the liberation of public spaces and end our
forced captivity in a spectator democracy.

<h3>Revolution And Insurgence</h3></a>

    Revolution is the overthrow of government; our aim is to overthrow
the media. Armed insurrection is unnecessary in so far as it is words and
images which are shot at us, not bullets. But the words and images which
keep us in bondage, which inundate us with the political muzak of
disinformation, half-baked scandals, shock, empty desires, and subliminal
imbeds are what enable State and corporate men to shoot bullets at people
outside our borders, slaughtering people like you and me by the thousands
in Iraq, in Panama, in Grenada, in El Salvador, in Libya, in Nicaragua, in
Africa. With the media in the hands of the public, State agents who order
secret wars, election riggings, destabilization programs and other covert
actions will be forced into open view and the democratic control of the
public.
<a href="seize_it.htm#top" name=p6>
<h3>The New Servant Class</h3></a>

    Establishing democratic legitimacy in America begins not with
overthrowing our governments, but with diminishing them to the role of
public servants. After all, in America, State agents are still employees
of the public. The Immediast goal is to make government officials the only
servants in our society, the audience of public expressions, the assistants
of public cultures, economy, and the archivists of public histories. The
legitimization of democratic government will come from multicultural public
movements, not State initiatives. The airwaves are public domain to be used
by and for the public&#151;and public movements will converge through the
establishment of national public media&#151;liberation of the airwaves. This
is our work for the 90s.
<a href="seize_it.htm#top" name=p7>
<h3>The Case Of USA vs. John Poindexter</h3></a>

    The outcome of the federal court case <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/walsh/chap_03.htm" target=_blank>USA vs. John Poindexter</a> has
pushed us from long standing civilian silence to insurgent Immediast
action. Look carefully: North and Poindexter reversed their felonies
by proving that extended media exposure destroyed case witnesses' ability
to think independently of the words and images the media had saturated
them with. This is now American history, a legal precedent. Admitting the
mind-control action of mass media protected State felons from public law.
The precedent of USA vs. John Poindexter thus establishes that:
<ol>
    <li>Spectacle representations derived from actual public events
       manipulate perception and control the natural outcome of
       our events.
    <li>Spectacle media disables the public to think and perceive
       freely of the biases imbedded by exposure to mass media noise
       and images.
</ol>
    Spectacle media serves as a moat protecting the National Security
State from public participation and democratic scrutiny. Meanwhile,
North and Poindexter, both felons, are back on the streets again.
<p>
    These crimes and their accomplices in the White House, CIA, NSA, CNN,
DOD, ABC, USIA, MTV, CBS etc are too much to tolerate given the increasing
violence, debt, recession, and systemic deception forced upon us every day
by the government and consumer media.
<p>
    Our drive to connect, to create, to love and make love, to play, to
communicate, to share, to live freely, to participate or be left in peace,
to represent our own desires and author our own cultures and live with
meaning that we together create are under relentless invasion and constant
assault. The time to change has come.
<p>
    We no longer tolerate being besieged with manipulative messages that
we don't want to hear and cannot respond to. We no longer tolerate an
inaccessible State that censors, blocks, denies information to the public.
We no longer tolerate the spectacle that ultimately serves to absolve
criminals like Poindexter, Bush, North and their lickspittles from crimes
of international violence and domestic debt. The time has come to turn the
ecology of coercion on itself. The time has come to veto, overwhelm, and
subvert the messages of all airborne commercial broadcast media until they
are returned to complete public direction, access, and control. How long
should we wait to liberate public spaces from the blister of billboards and
advertisements? The air is public domain, and the airwaves are ours to hear
our own voices, see our own colors, enjoy our own conversations, and
celebrate in the vast community of cultures. Remember: dialogue offsets
the hegemony, and intimacy empowers. 
<p>
    The time has come to restore the democratic power and public space that
have been coopted and colonized by commercial media.
<p>
    Celebrate public culture. Reconnect. Seize the media. The air is yours.
<p>
    In 1992 we begin the work that needs to be done. Asian philosophy
instructs <a href="critmass.htm">enlightenment</a>.

<h3>Towards An Ecology Of Information&#151;The Immediast Approach</h3></a>

<p><ul><strong>0.</strong> Participating in the proliferation, cross-pollination, 
and consolidation
   of counter-commercial print, audio, visual, modem, activist, and
   correspondence media. 

<p><strong>1.</strong> Documenting the basic sources, dynamics, and 
effects of corporate and
   State media control. Exposing methods of mind control, behavior
   modification, and image imbedding.

<p><strong>2.</strong> Openly discussing tools and methods that strengthen 
immunization and
   freedom from deceptive, disinforming, and subliminal media exposures.
   Upgrading public media literacy to decode, produce, and broadcast in
   all communications media. 

<p><strong>3.</strong> Open cultural expressions, education, networking and

<a href="seize_it.htm#top" name=p9>
<h3>The Immediast Approach</h3></a>

    The Immediasts invision liberation changes in public access and
cultural freedom. We draw from the powers of public domain and personal
freedom to counter the systemic penetrations of commercial media into
individual privacy through public space.
<p>
    Our actions are exerted through immediate and unpredictable means. We
believe that the institutional restraints imposed on social change drain
cultural growth and momentum rather than nurture their innovations and
initiatives. We recognize insurgence as a legitimate response to sustained
violation. We experience decommodification of consciousness and liberation
of public space as simultaneous projects, that occur together, side by
side, and at the same time. Immediast activity releases public insurgence
mounting to these ends, and works not only to reclaim the inviolability of
public attention and intelligence, but to equip and serve them with the
technology for cultural freedom and democratic power. This is not a
theoretical exercise aimed at intellectuals and folk on the left, this
is about equiping all sectors of the public to engage in the development
of a public media and an open State.

<p><ol>
    <li>Civilization has known no golden age. When people 
organize to create
       powers greater than any one person's ability to manage or maintain,
       power is used to advantage the few and control the many. Remember
       that human slavery was a brisk business in the United States until
       little more than 100 years ago. Saudi Arabia practiced slavery
       until the 1960s.
<p>
    <li> In industrial societies where people are organized 
into physical
       production, physical forces are used to control the public and,
       in turn, used by the public to vanquish over-concentrations of
       resources and power.
<p>
       In Information societies where populations are subject to abstract
       economies and manipulated by a landscape of images, infotainment,
       and advertising, people can seize democratic management of their
       political, cultural, and educational lives by gaining control of
       media. Such is the heart of Immediast theory, art, and action.
<p>
    <li> Revolution is the overthrow of government by its 
forced subjects;
       Immediaism is the seizure of media by its captive audience. The
       Immediast presence will amplify until all airborne corporate and
       commercial broadcast media are under complete public direction,
       access, and control.
</ol>
<a href="seize_it.htm#top" name=p10>
<h3>Towards An Immediast International</h3></a>

    <strong>I.</strong> Immediast actions, art, and insurgent networking 
reach their first
sphere of realization in the development of public production libraries
and the complete public seizure of all airborne commercial broadcast
media. We believe that consummate upgrades in the structure of social,
cultural and political life can only occur by public action outside the
channels of delay and diffusion operative in State institutions. Remember
USA vs. Poindexter. Remeber Dept. of Defense vs. <a href="http://www.thenation.com/" target=_blank>The Nation</a>, <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/" 
target=_blank>Village Voice</a>, <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/" target=_blank>Mother Jones</a>, <a href="http://www.progressive.org/" 
target=_blank>The Progressive</a>, and <a href="http://www.pacifica.org/" target=_blank>Pacifica Radio</a> et all. Remember.
<p>
    We have zero interest in passively watching the collapse of America's
two-wing business party that markets Leaders as a set of images and vapid
patriotic sentiments that can be grasped by a first grader through three
word bumper stickers and 20 second prime time TV commercials. Our goal is
to liberate public intelligence from such inane violations of space, time
and attention. Our efforts rest when Leaders, business party or otherwise,
are public servants whose every plan, project, and viewpoint is under
relentless accountability and scrutiny to an uninhibited public press.
Subscription government, public media, and an open state are what we're
after.
<p>
    By abolishing commercial imperatives, press pooling, and censorship,
media accessed and directed by the public paralyzes State ability to
conceal covert actions like Iran/Contra or the actions leading up to the
invasion of Panama and the abduction of that country's figurehead.
Domestically, we aim to collapse the ecology of coercion that depends on
buying and selling public attention through advertising&#151;and the stupor,
numbness, bigotry, and general ignorance it promotes. When our work is
done, advertising and billboards will fly beside the Soviet flag in the
museum of dead totalitarian experiments. 
<p>
    <strong>II.</strong> Immediast projects advance cultural ecologies that 
facilitate
public education, access and creativity. We support efforts to expand,
defend, and upgrade public space as free space.
<p>
    The real oppressiveness we experience is an oppression against our
cultures, awareness, and democratic power.
<p>
    Our revulsion with the violence of the State and coercion of the media
restrains our impulse to employ like meaures against the people whose work
it is to perpetuate the present system. It is our greater drive for
liberation from these conditions and life in fuller freedom tht directs our
actions towards systemic change rather than impeachment, incarceration, or
execution of individuals, though these may inevitably occur by
non-immediasts.
<p>
    From the vantage point of public media we can strip State agents of
all power beyond accountable public service, insuring that oppression has
no voice and coercion no media. Public media can gently remove the trump
card of "National Security" from the hands of the NSA, DOD, CIA, FBI, DOE,
etc, and begin organizing a democracy while dismantling the warheads of
America's covert State. As the people of the Russian commonwealth have
vanquished the central monologue controlling their lives and culture, so
too will we squelch the studios of coercion that prevent our democracy,
violate our intelligence, disrupt our space, and sell our attention.
This we will do by reclaiming the public airwaves.
<a href="seize_it.htm#top" name=p11>
<h3>Creating Public Production Libraries&#151;An Immediast Project</h3></a>

    If literacy measures people's ability to read and write, people living
in information societies are media illiterate&#151;unequiped to decode the
effects of media on intelligence and intimacy and unable to write in the
language of broadcasting. While the media's ecology of coercion assuages
public desire to participate in the media by emphasizing the bottom-line
significance of public polls, Gallop & its pathetic epigones merely
totalize a few public neurons into the status of a collective brain.
How many of your comrades and kin have ever participated is a Gallup
poll, anyway?
<p>
    Public seizure of all commercial broadcast media establishes what
public production libraries nurture: liberation from advertising, the
decommodification of public attention, the <a href="meme/IncreasingIntelligence.html">upgrade of public intelligence</a>,
the development of <b><a href="media/McLuhan.1.html">media literacy</a></b>, the documentation of public productions,
facilitated cultural expression, the termination of covert State action,
violence, propaganda, and media control, and the inviolable ground for a
public media and open state. Such are the aims of all Immediast plans and
projects.
<p>
    Public production libraries will be built in sisterhood with the
public libraries that now exist. Within each production library will be
the facilities to produce print, audio, visual, and database material.
"Librarians" will serve as technicians, maintainance, and repair people.
Production libraries will give people a larynx through which to speak.
The media seized, corporations silenced, and the State under relentless
scrutiny, we will reconect and celebrate who we are. 

<p>
    <strong>III.</strong> Regardless of their ostensibly radical message, 
alternative media
have generally reproduced the dominant spectacle-spectator relation. The
point is to undermine it&#151;to challenge the conditioning that makes people
susceptible to media manipulation in the first place. Which ultimately
means challenging the social organization that produces that conditioning,
that turns people into spectators of prefabricated adventures because they
are prevented from creating their own.&#151;Ken Knabbs, "The War and the
Spectacle", Retrofuturism 15.
<p>
    During recent years, artists and intellectuals have stopped talking
about Orwell and have begun talking back to the real media. Collectives
have formed and ink has flowed. With few exceptions, the main gripe
articulated has been against media misrepresentation and censorship.
Thinkers like <a href="http://www.chomsky.info/" target=_blank>Chomsky</a> and <a href="http://www.michaelparenti.org/" target=_blank>Parenti</a> have 
gone so far as to discuss the
underlying mechanisms used by the media to control perception,
"manufacture consent", and modify public behavior. Who, however, has
presented any clear plans or proposals for overcoming the hegemony of US
State and corporate broadcasting? The Immediasts are only the beginning.
<p>
    Recent activist initiatives have begun targeting the public
vulnerability to news, images, infotainment, and the pus of coercive images
that we all wallow in daily. All such critiques seem to presume that a
sudden outburst of free thinking and artistic disruption will somehow
wheedle, cajole, or enlighten the snakes coming out of the media Medusa.
With even less telos are those who devote their academic scrutiny to media
watch-dog activity, vulturing over the lies and propaganda as our history
is diswritten. Significant as their efforts, newsletters and intent are,
media reform in response to public pressure will never and can never
reorient the media's fundamental activity of preparing and commodifying
public attention for penetration by corporate advertisers. Alternative
viewpoints find airtime only if the corporate hegemons are convinced that
they can captivate an untapped public sector. Its always about markets,
never about movements.
<p>
    While diligent media activism can and eventually will alter media
representations of misgyny, racism, homophobia, and displays of violence,
sisyphean is the hope that anything short of public insurgence can
restructure the ecology of coercion systemic to our spectacle culture
and Security State. Because advertising is persuasion and propaganda is
news, "challenging the conditioning that makes people susceptible to
media manipulation"&#151;to quote Ken Knabb's tract in the recent issue of
<a href="http://www.streettech.com/bcp/BCPgraf/CyberCulture/retrofuturism.htm" target=_blank>Retrofuturism Magazine</a>&#151;is like challenging the air 
to reject pollutants.
People perceive that McDonalds and Burger King, republicans and democrats,
coke and pepsi, are actually alternatives to one another because the
imperatives of commercial media are to commodify choice, operate through
immersion, and totalize public perception. There is no escape, no
sanctuary, no retreat. Only deluge and bombardment, and the desire and
addiction that come with embeds left by long term over-exposure.
<p>
    Immediast tactics are not against challenging the conditioning that
make people passive consumers of spectacle politics and a culture of
coercion; we are against allowing our projects to stop at either personal
immunization or watchdog activity which are both only defensive positions.
The first asks us to mutate to the degraded environment, the second merely
documents it. Implicit in both approaches is an inertia about media's
fundamental activity of captivating, preparing, and selling public
attention to advertisers.
<blockquote>
   In the 20th century, he who controls the screen controls consciousness,
   information and thought. The screen is a mirror of your mind. If you're
   passively watching screens, you're being programmed. If you're editing
   you're own screen, you're in control of your mind.
<p>
   Americans voluntarily stick their amoeboid faces toward the screen
   seven hours a day and suck up information that Big Brother is putting
   there. Americans spend more time looking at monitors than they do
   gazing into the eyes of family and friends.&#151;<a href="leary.htm">Timothy Leary</a>
</blockquote>

<p>    <strong>IV.</strong> The Immediast counter-offensive studies and 
exerts tactics that
direct the spectacle against itself. Our rage and disgust are rooted in
our bondage as captive audience and forced spectators. Every billboard is
a repulsion to encounter. Every commercial that rapes our attention is no
less defiling an experience than the tourniquet of yellow ribbons that
strangled out American information and scrutiny during <a href="wc/wc-index.htm">the 42 days the
US slaughtered Iraqis</a>.
<p>
    Immediast tactics play on the immediacy of information systems and
experiment with ways to direct them against themselves. Staggering as our
situation has become, it is still only people and machines that maintain
it; the first we will overcome, the second we will seize.
<p>
    Stopping the spectacle involves engaging directly with it. Our
preliminary work must neutralize the key images and methods of coercion
repeated through the media and spectacle politics, while our final job is
to silence commercial media completely. The Immediast International exists
to provide these basic public services.
<p>
    The insurgent tactics of <a href="http://www.actuporalhistory.org/" target=_blank>ACT UP</a>, <a href="http://www.earthfirst.org/" 
target=_blank>Earth First!</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=art+fux" target=_blank>Art Fux</a>, the Sits, the
<a href="http://www.guerrillagirls.com/" target=_blank>Gorilla Girls</a>, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_Underground" 
target=_blank>Weathermen</a> are rich with lessons. We see now that
in a spectacle society, paradigmatic cultural, economic, and social
upgrades need not be spearheaded by revolution and violence. What we
do need to do is orient our connections, critiques, cultural production,
and collective action toward a state of democratic critical mass.
<p>
    Insightful, artistic or illuminating as our discourse may otherwise
be, without advancing the awareness and insurgence to take-over the media,
our discourse will continue to be pre-empted.

<h3>The Networker, A New Perception</h3></a>

    In societies where information and media are as inaccessible and
undemocratic as the governments that run them, uninhibited public
communication, expression, and cultural production are acts of freedom
and defiance. Rooted in the drive to connect and exchange with others,
Networkers' openly engage in international mail art, travel, copy-art,
computer bulletin boards, fax art, cassette exchange, cultural
disruptions, media hacking, pirate broadcasting, festivals, sex,
and all forms of improvisational communication and direct action.
