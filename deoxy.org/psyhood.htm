<h1>Psychologists, the New Priesthood<br>
<font size="-1">A question and answer with Osho</font></h1>
<blockquote><blockquote>
<strong>Question:</strong> Years ago I had contact with certain psychologists, and their ideas
seemed to set me free. I found new ways to understand myself, and met
people with integrity that I respected. I still love the poetry of
psychology. Now, reading some psychologists writing about so-called
cults, they sound like fanatics, priests and politicians. They want to
control people, not to free them. Can you please comment.
</blockquote>

<strong>Answer:</strong> That first idea of yours about psychologists was childish. There
is no poetry in psychology.
<p>
  Psychology is the latest instrument to keep people oppressed. Because the
priests have failed, new priests are needed. The psychologists are the new
priests, and obviously they have come with a new jargon, but the basis is
the same.
<p>
  The politician has been conspiring against you with the priest for
centuries. But now it seems the priest has lost hold of people. Churches
are empty, so empty that my people have purchased a church in Holland and
are turning it into a disco. In fact, that is a good beginning. I would
like all beautiful cathedrals and churches to be turned into discos. Now
nobody goes there. They are cold and dismal and dead.
<p>
  The politician is very cunning. He can see the priests have lost their
hold - at least on the younger generation. He has to find a substitute. The
psychologist has come in handy, because he speaks a different language than
the priest. He pretends that his psychology is a science. That is
absolutely wrong!
<p>
  It is not science; how can it be science when Freud, Jung, Adler,
Assagioli, are not agreeing on a single point? The four great psychologists&#151;and not agreeing on a single point! Science always comes to an agreement.
When the truth is known about anything, the scientist is humble enough to
drop his prejudices and accept it. It does not matter who has discovered
it, what matters is that it has been discovered.
<p>
  But the psychologists are divided in so many schools&#151;the same way as
religion was divided in so many religions, so many subdivisions of
religions, cults, creeds. The same is the situation now of psychology. But
the psychologist does not bring God in, does not bring heaven and hell
in. He has found different names for these entities. He does not talk about
man in the old terms the priests have always used; hence, you got caught in
their jargon.
<p>
  The psychologists don't say that you have to become and ascetic, that you
have to practice a certain discipline for years together, or perhaps for
lives together, and then you will be liberated, no.  They say
psychoanalysis will do, just go on being psychoanalyzed.
<p>
  I have never come across a single man whose psychoanalysis is complete.
In fact, even Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, is an
unpsychoanalyzed person. I have been trying to psychoanalyze him, and I am
finding treasures. I would not have believed it if somebody had told me
that Freud was so afraid of ghosts that even the word 'ghost' was enough,
and he would freak out.
<p>
  Once, talking to Jung, his most intimate follower at the time&#151;and Jung
was very much interested in ghosts. He started talking about ghosts, and
Sigmund Freud fainted. These are your founders of psychoanalysis. That was
the point where Sigmund Freud and Jung parted. Jung could see, "This man,
who cannot even listen to what I have to say about ghosts, and faints, is
not going to be my master." And Sigmund Freud also realized, "This man is
not going to be my successor." Sigmund Freud and Jung parted.
<p>
  Listening to me, you may be thinking that Jung was very much more
courageous that Sigmund Freud, because he was so interested in ghosts, but
that is not true. He was interested in ghosts because he was very much
afraid of death, and afraid of becoming a ghost!
<p>
  Jung wanted to go to Egypt to see the ancient mummies of kings and queens
preserved there. Almost ten times he booked his trip, but at the last
moment he would find some excuse and cancel the trip. The tenth time, he
even went to the airport; and the moment the departure of the plane was
announced, he chickened out. After that, he never made any attempt to go to
Egypt. He was very much afraid of a dead body. These people are certainly
in need of much psychological help.
<p>
  You say you were very much impressed. It was not that you had come across
something very impressive, it was only because you were ignorant,
impressionable&#151;anything would have impressed you, you were just soft
clay. Otherwise, to see poetry in psychology is insanity.
<p>
  There may be some psychology in poetry, but in psychology?... In
psychology you will find you psychologists talking about masturbation,
schizophrenia, nightmares, all kinds of madnesses. I don't think you can
find any poetry in all this. Nobody has found poetry in a medical book, and
the psychologist is dealing with far worse sicknesses than any medical book
can.
<p>
  But the politicians found that a substitute is urgently needed, and
psychoanalysis has become a worldwide movement. It was bound to. Sigmund
Freud was a Jew, and whenever a Jew starts a business, it is going to
become a worldwide chain.
<p>
  What did Jesus do? He was a Jew. And Jews have not forgiven him yet, for
the simple reason that they are angry with themselves for losing the great
business that Jesus had made available to them. Now Christianity is the
biggest business firm in the world. Sigmund Freud also made a great
business out of psychoanalysis. Jews know how to do business.
<p>
  Seeing that psychoanalysis was spreading fast, and people were trying to
find the meaning of life, some hope, trying to get rid of despair&#151;it was
simple for the politicians to use psychology, psychoanalysis, psychiatry,
in the service of the vested interests. That's what they have been doing.
<p>
  Now you are a little more mature. Seeing what the psychologists are
writing about cults, new movements&#151;they are all against new movements,
new religious beginnings&#151;it is very simple to see that they are in the
service of the past, not in the service of humanity's future.
<p>
  They have been purchased. They are the new priesthood! Beware of these
people. Because they are new they are more dangerous.
<p>
  Now psychoanalysts, psychiatrists, are providing deprogramming. If
somebody moves out of Christianity&#151;bored with all its nonsense&#151;and
joins a new movement, the psychologists are offering their services to the
parents, to the society. "Bring your boy or your girl and we will deprogram
the person." And they do it. Of course, they charge enough money.
<p>
  They can deprogram any cult: Jehovah's Witnesses, Jesus freaks... I am
surprised... Jesus himself was a freak. In fact, Jesus freaks are really
doing the right thing; to follow Jesus you have to be a Jesus freak. Jesus
was not a gentleman, not dressed in a gray business suit. You can think of
him as a freak, as a hippie, or anything, but he was not part of the old
conditioned mind. That's why he was rewarded with crucifixion.
<p>
  At that time deprogrammer psychologists had not arrived; otherwise Jesus
would have been saved from crucifixion. Just deprogramming would have been
enough. He had just to be constantly hammered: "You are not the only son of
God. Drop this nonsense. If you are the messiah for whom the whole Judaic
tradition is waiting, let them recognize you. Why do you go on shouting
that you are the awaited messiah?" It would have been very easy to
deprogram that poor carpenter, but the psychologists were not around there.
<p>
  In America they are doing great business, especially in California. They
are spreading in other countries also.
<p>
  You have found now the right attitude about these people. They don't want
any revolution in the world. They don't want any kind of religiousness in
the world. They don't want the new man in the world. And they are against
humanity, because only the new man can save it. Only the new man can throw
these politicians with their nuclear weapons into the Pacific&#151;pacific,
certainly, so they can be at peace forever.
<p>
  These deprogrammers are writing against cults, dogmas, and they don't
know anything about them. They don't come here. Not a single deprogrammer
psychologist has appeared, because he knows he will be deprogrammed.
<p>
  We have our own deprogrammers, who are certainly far more efficient, for
the simple reason that they are not giving you any program. So their work
is simple: they simply deprogram you and leave you alone to yourself. They
do not REprogram you. They give you freedom. Deprogrammed you are no longer
a Christian, no longer a Hindu, no longer a Mohammedan. You are no longer
an American, a Russian, a German. Completely deprogrammed, you are simply
an innocent, reborn child.
<p>
  My sannyasins are again reclaiming their childhoodness, their innocence,
which has been disturbed by the priests, by the politicians, by the
educationalists. In every way you have been cut to a certain size,
according to the dress that they have prepared for you. This is strange!
The dress should be cut according to you, and for centuries they have been
cutting you according to the dress. The dress is already available - the
Christian dress, the Hindu dress, the Buddhist dress - and you have to fit
into it. It is imprisionment.
<p>
  It is good that you have understood that these psychologists are the new
jailers. Beware of them.
<p>
  If anybody needs deprogramming, these are the people who need it. So if
you can catch hold of a deprogrammer, bring him here. We have to start
deprogramming the new priesthood, because we want the whole humanity to be
one.
<p>
  We don't want any priests, we don't want any religions and we don't want
any nations. We want the world to be one. Because only in one world is
there no need for nuclear weapons, is there no need for war. Right now,
seventy-five percent of human energy, income, resources are going to create
more and more weapons. And these politicians who go on piling up nuclear
weapons also go on shedding crocodile tears for Ethiopia.
<p>
  Ethiopia, with all its wounds, can be immediately healed. Half of the
population of India need not be existing below survival level. In America
itself, thirty million people are so poor that it is simply ugly and insane
for the American president to go on pouring money into nuclear weapons.
<p>
  And the amazing thing is, you have enough nuclear weapons to destroy
humanity seven hundred times! Strange, I don't see the arithmetic. Have
these politicians forgotten even the basic three R's? Russia and America
can destroy this planet seven hundred times. There is no need, one time is
enough! You have already got weapons seven hundred times more than you
need. Just an average mind can see the foolishness of it.
<p>
  Stop nuclear weapons, stop this whole idea of war. But the politician
knows if the priest disappears he will be in difficulty. He wants to
substitute the priest with the psychologist&#151;a more up-to-date version of
the same priesthood. There is no difference.
<p>
  It has to be stopped. So whenever you see a deprogrammer, catch hold of
him and bring him here. The way they are catching hold of people... what a
strange world! Parents are hijacking their own children and giving them
into the hands of the psychologist, and he hammers them.
<p>
  The method is very simple. He goes on hammering for two days, three days.
The man had been a Christian, now he has become a Hare Krishna. The Hare
Krishna ideology is only on the surface, very fragile, new; his
Christianity is centuries old in his unconscious. It is very easy to
deprogram him; his unconscious will be in your support. You have just to
scratch a little and his unconscious will start coming up.
<p>
  You have to make him feel guilty: "You betrayed Jesus Christ, the only
begotten son of God; you betrayed your country, you betrayed your
community." You have just to make him feel guilty&#151;that is scratching&#151;and soon his unconscious will be coming up.
<p>
  But nobody can deprogram my sannyasins, because we already do it and we
never give another program to people. We leave them completely free,
individual. We give them the dignity of being an individual and not just a
member of some religion. We give them the pride to be themselves and not be
an American or a Russian.
<p>
  My sannyasins, nobody can deprogram.
<p>
  In fact, if you find yourself in a situation where you are forced to be
deprogrammed, don't be afraid. Deprogram the deprogrammer! Don't miss the
chance. And I know you can do it!
