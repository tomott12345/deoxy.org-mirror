TEXT OF 'THUNDER: PERFECT MIND'

I was sent forth from the power,
 and I have come to those who reflect upon me,
 and I have been found among those who seek after me.
Look upon me, you (pl.) who reflect upon me,
 and you hearers, hear me.
 You who are waiting for me, take me to yourselves.
And do not banish me from your sight.
 And do not make your voice hate me, nor your hearing.
 Do not be ignorant of me anywhere or any time. Be on your guard!
 Do not be ignorant of me.

For I am the first and the last. 
I am the honored one and the scorned one.
I am the whore and the holy one. 
I am the wife and the virgin. 
I am <the mother> and the daughter.
I am the members of my mother.
I am the barren one
 and many are her sons.
I am she whose wedding is great,
 and I have not taken a husband.
I am the midwife and she who does not bear. 
I am the solace of my labor pains. 
I am the bride and the bridegroom,
 and it is my husband who begot me.
I am the mother of my father
 and the sister of my husband,
 and he is my offspring.
I am the slave of him who prepared me. 
I am the ruler of my offspring.
 But he is the one who [begot me] before the time
  on a birthday. 
 And he is my offspring [in] (due) time,
  and my power is from him.
I am the staff of his power in his youth,
 [and] he is the rod of my old age.
 And whatever he wills happens to me.
I am the silence that is incomprehensible
 and the idea whose remembrance is frequent.
I am the voice whose sound is manifold
 and the word whose appearance is multiple.
I am the utterance of my name.

Why, you who hate me, do you love me,
 and you hate those who love me?
You who deny me, confess me,
 and you who confess me, deny me.
You who tell the truth about me, lie about me,
 and you who have lied about me, tell the truth about me.
You who know me, be ignorant of me,
 and those who have not known me, let them know me.

For I am knowledge and ignorance.
I am shame and boldness. 
I am shameless; I am ashamed.
I am strength and I am fear.
I am war and peace. 
Give heed to me. 
I am the one who is disgraced and the great one.

Give heed to my poverty and my wealth.
Do not be arrogant to me when I am cast out upon the earth,
 [and] you will find me in [those that] are to come.
And do not look [upon] me on the dung-heap
 nor go and leave me cast out,
 and you will find me in the kingdoms.
And do not look upon me when I am cast out among those who
 are disgraced and in the least places,
 nor laugh at me.
And do not cast me out among those who are slain in violence.
But I, I am compassionate and I am cruel.
Be on your guard!
Do not hate my obedience
 and do not love my self-control.
In my weakness, do not forsake me,
 amd do not be afraid of my power.
For why do you despise my fear
 and curse my pride?

But I am she who exists in all fears
 and strength in trembling. 
I am she who is weak,
 and I am well in a pleasant place. 
I am senseless and I am wise.

Why have you hated me in your counsels?
For I shall be silent among those who are silent,
 and I shall appear and speak.
Why then have you hated me, you Greeks?
 Because I am a barbarian among [the] barbarians?
For I am the wisdom [of the] Greeks
 and the knowledge of [the] barbarians.
I am the judgment of [the] Greeks and the barbarians.
[I] am the one whose image is great in Egypt
 and the one who has no image among the barbarians.
I am the one who is hated everywhere
 and who has been loved everywhere.
I am the one whom they call Life,
 and you have called Death.
I am the one whom they call Law,
 and you have called Lawlessness.
I am the one whom you have pursued,
 and I am the one whom you have seized.
I am the one you have scattered,
 and you have gathered me together.
I am the one before whom you have been ashamed,
 and you have been shameless to me.
I am she who does not keep festival, 
 and I am she whose festivals are many.
I, I am godless,
 and I am one whose God is great.
I am the one whom you have reflected upon,
 and you have scorned me.
I am unlearned,
 and they learn from me.
I am the one whom you have despised,
 and you reflect upon me.
I am the one whom you have hidden from,
 and you appear to me.
 But whenever you hide yourselves,
  I myself will appear.
 For [whenever] you [appear],
  I myself [will hide] from you.
Those who have [...] to it [...] senselessly [...].

Take me [... understanding] from grief,
 and take me to yourselves from understanding [and] grief.
And take me to yourselves from places that are ugly and in ruin,
 and rob from those which are good even though in ugliness.
Out of shame, take me to yourselves shamelessly;
 and out of shamelessness and shame, upbraid my members
  in yourselves.
And come foreward to me, you who know me
   and you who know my members,
 and establish the great ones among the small first creatures.
Come foreward to childhood,
 and do not despise it because it is small and it is little.
And do not turn away greatness in some parts from the
   smallnesses,
 for the smallnesses are known from the greatnesses.

Why do you curse me and honor me?
You have wounded and you have had mercy.
Do not separate me from the first ones whom you have [known].
[And] do not cast anyone [out nor] turn anyone away
  [...] turn away and [... know] him not.
  [... him].
  What is mine [...].
I know the [first ones] and those after them [know] me.

But I am the mind of [...] and the rest of [...].
I am the knowledge of my inquiry,
 and the finding of those who seek after me,
 and the command of those who ask of me,
 and the power of the powers in my knowledge
   of the angels, who have been sent at my word,
   and of the gods in their seasons by my counsel,
   and of the spirits of every man who exists with me,
    and of the women who dwell within me.
I am the one who is honored, and who is praised,
  and who is despised scornfully.
I am peace, 
  and war has come because of me.
I am an alien and a citizen.
I am the substance and the one who has no substance.

Those who are without association with me are ignorant of me,
 and those who are in my substance are the ones who know me.
Those who are close to me have been ignorant of me,
 and those who are far away from me are the ones who have
   known me.
On the day when I am close to [you],
   [you] are far away [from me],

[I am ...] within.
[I am ...] of the natures.
I am [...] of the creation of the spirits.

[I am] control and the uncontrollable.
I am the union and the dissolution.
I am the abiding and the dissolving.
I am the one below,

<h2><a name="comments">COMMENTARY</a></h2>
    "Thunder, Perfect Mind" is a poem from the <i>Nag Hammadi</i> texts.
Stylistically, three separate styles are used in the poem: that
of Hebrew wisdom-texts, of Isis aretalogies, and Platonic dialog.
These three styles are used in alternation. Religiously, it is
hard to identify the tradition this text comes from. It presents
no distinctively Jewish, orthodox Christian, or gnostic Christian
themes, not does it seem to presuppose any known gnostic "myths."
<p>
    If the document is to be considered a gnostic document, a
definition of gnostic must be tendered first. For now, the
definition of Theodotus will be used, that "what liberates us is
the knowledge of who we were, what we became; where we were,
whereunto we have been thrown; whereunto we speed, wherefrom we
are redeemed; what birth is, and what rebirth." "Thunder: Perfect
Mind" answers some of these questions, but not others.
<p>    
    The questions dealing with self-knowledge are dealt with very
fully in the text. The tradition of Isis aretalogies is one of
self-definition, aretalogies being strings of "I am" statements.
The part of the text like an Isis aretalogy describes the speaker
in paradoxical but full detail. The very first section of the
aretalogy text answers the questions of where the speaker comes
from, where she has come to, and where she might be found. There
is a slight deviation, in that she has actively come to "those
who reflect" upon her, rather than "being thrown" to them, 
the idea of being removed from one's original habitation is
there. In the sixth section of this part she says that she is an
alien, as well as a citizen.
<p>    
    This brings up the question of what the point of the
dichotomies in the aretalogy section is. They range from
philosophical, political and social opposites to sexual and
familial polarities. In each opposition of polarity, the speaker
maintains that she encompasses both poles, or roles. She is "the
whore and the holy one." She is "the barren one, and she whose
sons are many." She is "Knowledge and ignorance." And she is "the
one whom they call Law, and you have called Lawlessness."
<p>    
    In the last dichotomy, the difference may be ascribed to the
people who call her either Law or Lawlessness, either "they" or
"you." Similar distinctions are made in other seemingly
paradoxical statements in terms of temporal placement. The tenses
change, for instance, in the fifth section in many statements,
such as "I am the one who is hated everywhere, and who has been
loved everywhere.", "I am the one whom you have despised, and you
reflect upon me." and "I am the one whom you have hidden from,
and you appear to me." These distinctions, either temporal or
nominal, are subservient to the larger message that the speaker
is a very diverse personality. They are also only possible to
discern in a small percentage of the proffered paradoxes. The
main attempt is to define herself, not to set up distinctions in
time or peoples. There is almost no cosmology or anthropology in
this text, and this is a clue to the nature of the message of the
text. The emphasis is on the person, not the cosmos; on the self,
and not the environment.
<p>     
     In this aretalogy third of the text, there an attempt to
transcend the intellect through intellectual paradox. By setting
up identities between polar opposites the mind is set in circles,
as it is by the Zen koans, until it is driven into the brick wall
of impossibility. In the introduction to his translation of this
text, MacRae states that "...the particular significance of the
self-proclamations of Thunder: Perfect Mind may be found in
their antithetical character." One might rather say that the
significance must be found in their antithetical character. There
is no other common denominator.
<p>     
     The second type of writing seen in this text is comparable
to Hebrew wisdom literature. The excerpted and reconnected text
is a series of hortatory instructions for those who would be
gnostikoi, in the form of very short injunctions to "Look upon
me", "Hear me", "Do not be arrogant to me", etc. The speaker
exhorts the reader to be on his guard twice, and not to be
ignorant of her twice. This emphasis on care and awareness
augments the intellectual exercises of the aretalogy section. One
could easily skim over the polarities and not stop to reflect on
them or their import, in which case their efficacy of liberation
would be severely diminished. All three parts of this text work
together.
<p>     
     The exhortations go on to impress upon the reader that he
must be aware that the speaker encompasses all things, great and
small, as well as left and right, male and female, royal and
base, rich and poor. There is an  element of the union of
opposites here as well, the speaker saying she is compassionate
and cruel, and obedient and self-controlled
<p>     
     In the third section of this part of the text, the
instructions are to "come forward to me, you who know me ... and
establish the great ones among the small first creatures." Here
is some evidence of an organised attempt to proselytise, or
establish a group of those who know the speaker. The fourth
 section also calls to "you, who know me." They are told to learn
the speaker's words, while those "hearers" are told simply to
hear. This suggests some form of hierarchy among the "hearers"
and the "knowers". The first step would seem to be that one must
hear the voice, and then come to know it.
<p>     
     This could be a sign of the initiatory path, along which one
must pass to come to gnosis. As noted above, the simple act of
hearing the message intellectually would not be enough. One must
pay special care to the paradoxes presented, and reflect upon
them until illumination comes. The process can again be compared
to the effect of koans, where one perceives them first as
outright nonsense, "the sound of one hand clapping," etc., until
one comes to the crux of where they attempt to fix the mind.
<p>    
    Where the "Thunder: Perfect Mind" would fix the mind is on a
realisation of the transcendence of the speaker, and eventually
on the identification of the speaker with the hearer when that
hearer becomes a knower. As it says in the sixth section of the
aretalogy part, "I am the knowledge of my inquiry, and the
finding of those who seek after me, ... and of the spirits of
every who exists with me, and of the women who dwell within me."
The path to gnosis and the traveler on that path are both played
here by the character of the speaker.
<p>     
     Another point made by this part of the text like wisdom
literature is that manifestation implies duality, and that to
perceive in the world implies discrimination. The nature of the
speaker comprehends all things, but to appear in the world she
must choose one of the two halves of all those things through
which to appear. As a complete being she would be both invisible
and insensible in any way, since to contain both poles of being,
such as 1 and -1, would be to equal 0. This has a parallel in the
way of the Tao, in which one of the aims is to do everything by
doing nothing. One might hear the speaker saying "I am she who
does everything, and nothing." The idea is to incorporate in
oneself a balance between action and non-action, yin and yang,
and by doing such one gets beyond having to struggle with the
world. There will be no antagonism between the person and then
environment, once that person becomes one with the environment.
(Or a reflection of it, by incorporating or epitomising all its
elements.)
<p>    
    This shows the less ascetic nature of the text "Thunder:
Perfect Mind". The world is not actively evil, but rather simply
distracting due to its incomplete nature. When one gets beyond
this, then one has improved, but there is no shame in being
merely a "hearer," and not a "knower." The only desiderata are to
hear and then to know, to balance oneself according to what one
comes to know, and despise nothing along the way, for every thing
is part of the transcendent whole. Here one could draw Deist
parallels, intensifying the impression that the writers of this
text did not see the world as inherently evil.
<p>     
     It is our perception of the world that causes the apparent
evil of the world. To perceive something is to discriminate
between it and its context. It is this separation or making of
differences that allows us to operate in the world, but also that
enslaves us to it by monopolising our attention. "Thunder:
Perfect Mind" insists that only by seeing the larger picture of
unions of all opposites can we escape this servitude to the
world. In other words, what liberates us is the knowledge of into
what we have been thrown, or have come.
<p>     
     The last section, the fifth of this part of the text, is a
final exhortation to the reader to "look," "give heed" and be
aware of who speaks and what that means, that by encompassing all
things she is "the one who alone exists," comprising all, "and
... no one who will judge" her exists outside her. This extreme
recognition of the unity of oneself with the cosmos, of subject
with object, and of positive and negative, leads to an extension
of the self to the limits of perception. Sometimes this continues
to the point that manifestation requires a relimitation by
definition of person. As the speaker has done this, the extension
and then the relimitation in order to communicate, she also
implies that it is an achievement attainable by all, if one will
just "hear" and "know."
<p>     
     The third part of the text represents Greece, as the first
two reflect the Egyptian and Judaic strands of the Hellenistic
world. It consists of questions and answers, not always on
philosophical subjects, but always leading to philosophical
points. It is similar in many ways to the prototypical Platonic
dialogue in which the interlocutor is led to the truth of the
matter by way of dialectic. Another parallel would be the
dialogue between Arjuna and Krishna in that chariot.
<p>     
     There are six sections to this part of the text, as it has
been cut up and fitted to the other two parts, and the first five
display an elegant ring composition. Section one is a question
and amplification of the question, while section five is the
answer to it. Section two is another question and amplification,
answered by section four. Section three is the center point,
pointing out the union of the two questions and their respective
answers. Section six is a conclusion of sorts, resuming that
which the dialogue has attempted to draw.
<p>     
     The first question is why the reader, and people in general,
display contradictory behavior. This is not a psychological type
of inquiry, into the roots of irrationality, but rather another
attempt to unveil the nature of the speaker. The contradictory
behavior referred to deals with the reader's reaction to the
speaker, and the nature of complete being in general. If complete
being entails all things, then it elicits all responses, each of
which will have an opposite reaction that will be elicited
simultaneously (or thereabouts). Love and hate, truth and lie,
knowledge and ignorance are all part of man's reactions to the
world.
<p>     
     The answer to this problem is contained in section five. The
incompleteness of things, inside and outside, judge and judged,
condemning and acquitting; these distinctions elicit opposite
responses to each of their halves, yet both halves are only that:
halves of a whole, which elicits both love and hate, fear and
confidence, and obedience and self-control. The way out of the
world of appearances is again to realise the unity of opposites,
that what is seen inside is what is outside also.
<p>     
     The second question is directed toward the question of the
ignorance of these unions of opposites. "Why have you hated me,"
asks the unity, "Because I am a barbarian among barbarians?
Because I don't speak the language of any specific nation, not
even those who don't speak your language? Because I speak of
universals?" The answer is that "those who are without
association with me are ignorant of me, and those who are in my
substance are the ones who know me." Those who know, know; those
who don't don't. One cannot understand the nature of the speaker
or the world until one becomes a part of it, and all the parts of
it. The antithetical and polarised nature continues to be shown,
"On the day when I am close to you, you are far away from me, and
on the day when I am far away from you, I am close to you."
<p>     
     The third section unites these two questions of the
manifestation of opposites, and the difficulty of perception of
perfection. (not to mention perfection of perception!) Both
problems stem from human nature in the world of manifestation.
The separation of opposites, needed for perception of manifested
things, is necessary to operate in the world as humans with human
limitations, as these limitations are usually counted. But the
speaker here says the real need ideally is not to separate, and
thus to come to a realisation of the unity. This is similar to
the idea of samadhi, where the subject and object of
contemplation are united in a flash of illumination.
<p>     
     Section six concludes, saying that the worldly forms are
pleasant, but numerous, disgraceful, and fleeting. When men
"become sober and go up to their resting place.... they will find
me there, and they will live, and they will not die again." This
implies the possibility of a permanent state of comprehension of
the unity of opposites.
<p>     
     Now we can see where Theodotus' definition of gnosticism is
and is not exemplified by "Thunder: Perfect Mind". The writers of
this text were concerned with most of Theodotus' questions, but
not all. They provide answers for where we have come from, and
whereunto we have been thrown. They address the question of who
we were, what we have become, but not really what birth is, and
what rebirth. Nor do they proffer answers to whereunto we speed,
or wherefrom we are redeemed, beyond the answers to the first
questions of where we were and where we are. The answers that are
offered deal with personal rather than cosmological questions (if
there is a difference). The issue is primarily one of
self-liberation, rather than redemption, unless the reception of
the "good news" of unity is to be considered redemption.
<p>     
     This difference of degree of activity and passivity between
Theodotus and the speaker of "Thunder: Perfect Mind" is revealed
in the answers to whereunto we have been thrown, and wherefrom we
are redeemed. In "Thunder: Perfect Mind"'s view we came ourselves
to this world, and liberate ourselves through Hearing and
Knowing. What liberates us is still the knowledge, but the
knowledge of slightly different things. The lack of cosmology or
theology in the text, compared to other texts in the Nag Hammadi
library, suggests the comparison rather to the more psychological
sect of Buddhism [Craig Schenk's Note: Theravada] in contrast to
the majority of Mahayana that has absorbed local religious or
theological superstructure.
<p>     
     The path suggested by the text towards illumination is a
strictly intellectual path to the transcendence of intellect.
Through the mortification of the mind rather than of the flesh
one may achieve gnosis. There is therefore no need for a theology
on which to hang precepts of asceticism. The authors of the text
say simply that when one understands the facts, one gives up the
preoccupation of the world as incomplete.
<p>     
     The gnosticism exemplified by this text then, is
transcendental, syncretic, and hortatory. It is transcendent in
that it looks at the world and insists that there is a larger
reality beyond what we see as separate, discrete things. It is
syncretic in that it uses three distinct literary styles to get
across its point. These three texts may have been actual texts on
their own before incorporation into this text, or they may not.
They fit so smoothly into each other in terms of subject
continuity that were they originally distinct texts, they must
have been revised for the purpose. The authors are hortatory as
opposed to imperative in that they say that if you come to their
idea of unity, then you will be less confused by the complexity
of the world. If you do not, then you will stick to all those
pleasant forms of passions and fleeting pleasures, and simply not
achieve peace. They do not threaten any punishment for ignorance,
only a perpetuation of a potentially temporary confusion.
<p>     
     The comparisons of the three styles of writings is
profitable only in so far as it serves to conveniently categorise
the material. Too strict an analogy to the three styles would be
blinding as well. The content is radically different in message
from the usual content of any of the borrowed forms. Again, what
must be looked at to explain the meaning of the text is the
antithetical nature of the "I am" statements, and their
commentary in the other two styles of text. The medium (in this
case) is not the message. The function of the text must be
considered to be not philosophical speculation, theological or
moral exhortation or religious definition, as the borrowed types
were, but rather psychological revelation, buttressed by
practical exhortation and logical proof.
<p>    
    What really qualifies the author or authors of this text for
consideration as excellent and true gnostics is their
appropriation of existing forms, whether myths, ritual speeches,
or philosophical methods, and turning them to their own ends.
