SEC. 220. UNMANNED ADVANCED CAPABILITY COMBAT AIRCRAFT AND GROUND COMBAT 
            VEHICLES.

    (a) Goal.--It shall be a goal of the Armed Forces to achieve the 
fielding of unmanned, remotely controlled technology such that--
            (1) by 2010, one-third of the aircraft in the operational 
        deep strike force aircraft fleet are unmanned; and
            (2) by 2015, one-third of the operational ground combat 
        vehicles are unmanned.

    (b) Report on Unmanned Advanced Capability Combat Aircraft and 
Ground Combat Vehicles.--(1) Not later than January 31, 2001, the 
Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense 
committees a report on the programs to demonstrate unmanned advanced 
capability combat aircraft and ground combat vehicles undertaken jointly 
between the Director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency 
and any of the following:
            (A) The Secretary of the Army.
            (B) The Secretary of the Navy.
            (C) The Secretary of the Air Force.

    (2) The report shall include, for each program referred to in 
paragraph (1), the following:
            (A) A schedule for the demonstration to be carried out under 
        that program.
            (B) An identification of the funding required for fiscal 
        year 2002 and for the future-years defense program to carry out 
        that program and for the demonstration to be carried out under 
        that program.
            (C) In the case of the program relating to the Army, the 
        plan for modification of the existing memorandum of agreement

[[Page 114 STAT. 1654A-39]]

        with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency for 
        demonstration and development of the Future Combat System to 
        reflect an increase in unmanned, remotely controlled enabling 
        technologies.

    (3) The report shall also include, for each Secretary referred to in 
paragraphs (1)(A), (1)(B), and (1)(C), a description and assessment of 
the acquisition strategy for unmanned advanced capability combat 
aircraft and ground combat vehicles planned by that Secretary, which 
shall include a detailed estimate of all research and development, 
procurement, operation, support, ownership, and other costs required to 
carry out such strategy through the year 2030, and--
            (A) in the case of the acquisition strategy relating to the 
        Army, the transition from the planned acquisition strategy for 
        the Future Combat System to an acquisition strategy capable of 
        meeting the goal specified in subsection (a)(2);
            (B) in the case of the acquisition strategy relating to the 
        Navy--
                    (i) the plan to implement a program that examines 
                the ongoing Air Force unmanned combat air vehicle 
                program and identifies an approach to develop a Navy 
                unmanned combat air vehicle program that has the goal of 
                developing an aircraft that is suitable for aircraft 
                carrier use and has maximum commonality with the 
                aircraft under the Air Force program; and
                    (ii) an analysis of alternatives between the 
                operational deep strike force aircraft fleet and that 
                fleet together with an additional 10 to 20 unmanned 
                advanced capability combat aircraft that are suitable 
                for aircraft carrier use and capable of penetrating 
                fully operational enemy air defense systems; and
            (C) in the case of the acquisition strategy relating to the 
        Air Force--
                    (i) the schedule for evaluation of demonstration 
                results for the ongoing unmanned combat air vehicle 
                program and the earliest possible transition of that 
                program into engineering and manufacturing development 
                and procurement; and
                    (ii) an analysis of alternatives between the 
                currently planned deep strike force aircraft fleet and 
                the operational deep strike force aircraft fleet that 
                could be acquired by fiscal year 2010 to meet the goal 
                specified in subsection (a)(1).

    (c) Funds.--Of the amount authorized to be appropriated for Defense-
wide activities under section 201(4) for the Defense Advanced Research 
Projects Agency, $100,000,000 shall be available only to carry out the 
programs referred to in subsection (b)(1).
    (d) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:
            (1) An aircraft or ground combat vehicle has ``unmanned 
        advanced capability'' if it is an autonomous, semi-autonomous, 
        or remotely controlled system that can be deployed, re-tasked, 
        recovered, and re-deployed.
            (2) The term ``currently planned deep strike force aircraft 
        fleet'' means the early entry, deep strike aircraft fleet 
        (composed of F-117 stealth aircraft and B-2 stealth aircraft) 
        that is currently planned for fiscal year 2010.

[[Page 114 STAT. 1654A-40]]

            (3) The term ``operational deep strike force aircraft 
        fleet'' means the currently planned deep strike force aircraft 
        fleet, together with at least 30 unmanned advanced capability 
        combat aircraft that are capable of penetrating fully 
        operational enemy air defense systems.
            (4) The term ``operational ground combat vehicles'' means 
        ground combat vehicles acquired through the Future Combat System 
        acquisition program of the Army to equip the future objective 
        force, as outlined in the vision statement of the Chief of Staff 
        of the Army.
