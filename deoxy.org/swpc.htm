<p><h1>  <a name="The Software Patent Crisis">The Software Patent Crisis</a></h1> </p>

<p> An explosion of patents on software processes may radically change the
programming industry&#151;and our concept of human expression in the computer
age. </p>

<p> Last August, Refac International, Ltd., sued six major spreadsheet publishers,
including Lotus, Microsoft, and Ashton-Tate, claiming they had infringed
on <a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4398249.html">U.S. Patent No. 4,398,249</a>. The patent deals with a technique called "natural
order recalc," a common feature of spreadsheet programs that allows a change
in one calculation to reverberate throughout a document. Refac itself does
not have a spreadsheet program and is not even in the software industry.
Its business is acquiring, licensing, and litigating patents. </p>

<p> Within the last few years, software developers have been surprised to 
learn that hundreds, even thousands, of patents have been awarded for programming
processes ranging from sequences of machine instructions to features of the
user interface. Many of the patents cover processes that seem conventional
or obvious, and developers now fear that any of the thousands of individual
processes in their programs may be subject to patent-infringement claims. 
</p>
<p> The Refac suit demonstrates the vulnerability of the industry to such 
claims. Patent no. 4,398,249 was applied for in 1970, granted in 1983, and
only recently acquired by Refac. In the meantime, software developers have
been busily creating spreadsheets and other new products unmindful of patents.
The industry accepted copyright and trade secret as adequate protection for
its products, and most programmers assumed that patents were not generally
available for software. </p>
<table align="right" width="300" cellpadding="15"><tr><td><font size="+2">

</td></tr></table>
<p> Never before has an industry in which copyright was widely established 
suddenly been subjected to patenting. As it is, only a few companies that
create microcomputer software have the resources to try to defend against
patent infringement claims. Most small firms will be forced to pay license
fees rather than contest the claims, even though many software patents may
not stand up in court. </p>

<p> In the long run, the costs of doing business in a patent environment will
radically restructure the industry. Many small companies will fold under
the costs of licensing, avoiding patent infringement, and pursuing patents
defensively. The individual software entrepreneur and inventor may all but
disappear. There will be fewer publishers and fewer products, and the price
of software will rise to reflect the costs. </p>

<p> Especially disturbing is that the broad claims of many recent software 
patents appear to establish monopolies on the automation of such common functions
as generating footnotes and comparing documents. Some claims even cover processes
for presenting and communicating information, raising troubling questions
about the effect of patents on the future of computer-mediated expression. 
</p>

<p><h2> <a name="Patent vs. Copyright" href="swpc.htm#top">Patent vs. Copyright</a></h2>

<p> Software patents, like all patents, give an inventor the right to exclude
all others from making, selling, or using an invention for 17 years. In return,
the patentee discloses his or her "best method" of implementing the invention,
thereby relinquishing trade secrets that might otherwise be enforced forever
(like the formula for Coca-Cola). </p>

<p> To obtain a patent, an applicant must convince Patent Office examiners 
that the invention would not be obvious to a "person of ordinary skill in
the art" who is familiar with all the "prior art," which includes previous
patents and publications. In contrast, copyright inheres in books, poems,
music, and other works of authorship, including computer programs, from the
moment they are created. Registering one's work with the <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/">Copyright Office</a>
is a simple, inexpensive procedure that has important benefits (it is a precondition
for filing suit, for example), but the copyright itself is automatic when
the work is fixed on paper or on disk. </p>

<p> Copyright and patent protect different things. Copyright protects expression
but not underlying ideas. Patents protect useful processes, machines, and
compositions of matter. Traditionally "processes" have included methods of
physically transforming materials but not business methods or mental steps. 
Thus, computer programs fall somewhere between the traditional territories
of copyright and patent. </p>

<p> From the 1960s to the early 1980s, the Patent Office and the courts
grappled with the question of whether algorithms&#151;the elemental processes
on which computer programs are built&#151;are patentable as either processes
or machines. Early on, the Patent Office granted some patents for processes
built into computer hardware that today would be contained in software, but 
it was reluctant to grant patents for programs per se. As the 1966 Report
of the President's Commission on the Patent System pointed out, the Patent
Office had no system for classifying programs. The report also noted that
even if this were remedied, the volume of programs being created was so enormous
that reliable searches of "prior art" would not be feasible or economical. 
</p>
<p> However, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Customs_and_Patent_Appeals">Court of Customs and Patent Appeals (CCPA)</a> maintained that
computer programs were patentable and overturned numerous Patent Office decisions
denying patentability. The Supreme Court vindicated the Patent Office in
two decisions, <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottschalk_v._Benson">Gottschalk v. Benson</a> (1972) and <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker_v._Flook">Parker v. Flook</a> (1978), holding 
that mathematical algorithms were not patentable subject matter. Still, the
CCPA continued to uphold patentability in other cases. Finally, in <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=450&invol=175">Diamond v. Diehr</a> (1981), a sharply divided Supreme Court upheld the patentability
of a process for curing rubber that included a computer program. The majority
concluded that programs that did not preempt all uses of a computer algorithm 
could be patented&#151;at least when used in a traditional process for physically
transforming materials. </p>

<p> That case has been the Supreme Court's last word on the subject. But
despite the narrowness of the ruling, the Patent Office underwent a radical
change of heart. Until very recently, there were no reported appeals of adverse
Patent Office decisions, leading observers to conclude that the office was
eventually granting almost all applications for software patents. Although 
articles began appearing in legal periodicals a few years ago noting that
patents were being routinely granted for many software processes, not until
1988 did the industry realize that the rules were changing, or had already
changed, in the middle of the game. By the spring of 1989, the patents that
entered the pipeline after Diamond v. Diehr were starting to flow out in significant
numbers&#151;by one count, nearly 200 in the first four months of that year. </p>

<p><h2> <a name="Processing Problems" href="swpc.htm#top">Processing Problems</a></h2>

<p> Unfortunately, the Patent Office classification system remains unchanged,
and the volume of software being created has grown exponentially. This makes
searching for prior art&#151;processes already in public use&#151;time-consuming
and expensive. </p>

<p> The search is extraordinarily difficult because the field's printed literature
is thin and unorganized. Software documents its own design, in contrast to
physical processes, which require written documentation. Also, software is
usually distributed without source code under licenses that forbid reverse 
engineering. This may amount to suppressing or concealing the invention and
therefore prevent the program from qualifying as prior art. The search for
prior art may require securing oral testimony from people who developed software
at universities many years ago, an expensive proposition. </p>

<p> Many programmers suspect that patent examiners lack knowledge of the
field, especially since the Patent Office does not accept computer science
as a qualifying degree for patent practice (it accepts degrees in electrical
engineering). Moreover, attracting and holding individuals with expertise
in a field like software, where industry demand is high, is not easy for
a government agency. Less qualified examiners create problems because they 
naturally have a lower standard in determining the hypothetical "person having
ordinary skill in the art," and are thus more apt to grant patents for obvious
processes. Since the examination process is conducted ex parte (as a private
matter between the Patent Office and the applicant), less qualified personnel
are also more likely to be influenced by sophisticated patent attorneys and
the apparent expertise of the applicant. </p>

<p> The quality of software patents being awarded has aroused concern even
among patent lawyers and other advocates of the new regime. But it will be
left to firms being sued for infringement to prove that a process should
not have been patented because it was obvious in view of the prior art. Meanwhile,
software patents stand as intimidating weapons for those who hold them. </p>

<p><h2> <a name="Restructuring the Industry" href="swpc.htm#top">Restructuring the Industry</a> </h2>

<p> Perhaps because of some of these problems, applications for software
patents take an average of 32 months to be approved and published. That's
significantly longer than the overall average of 20 months, and a very long
time given the short product cycles of the software business. </p>

<p> Unlike copyright, independent creation is irrelevant to patent infringement.
Every developer is charged with knowledge of all patents. Even if someone
is not aware of a patent, he or she can still infringe against it. Furthermore,
patent applications and the examination process are confidential, so there
are ordinarily several years of patents in the pipeline that no search will 
reveal. Although no infringement occurs until the patent issues, an inventor
may find that a newly awarded patent covers a feature he or she has already
incorporated and marketed in a finished product. While this is a problem
for the patent system as a whole, it is intolerable for software developers
because of the industry's rapid pace of innovation and long patent-processing 
period. </p>

<p> The problem is compounded by the fact that a modern software package
may contain thousands of separately patentable processes, each of which adds
to the risk of infringing patents that are already in the pipeline. Since
software functions are interdependent and must be carefully integrated, developers
can find it difficult to excise a process built into the original program. 
</p>

<table align="right" width="300" cellpadding="15"><tr><td><font size="+2">
The patent system exacts a high penalty in an industry as decentralized
as software.</font>
</td></tr></table>

<p> The patent system exacts a high penalty in an industry as decentralized
as software. Programming requires no special materials, facilities, or tools:
to design software is to build it. Because barriers to entry are low, the
industry attracts many small players, including hundreds of thousands of individuals
who work as consultants or short-term employees. Rather than a handful of
competitors working on the same problem, there are likely to be dozens, hundreds,
even thousands. Since under the patent system one winner takes all, many others&#151;including
developers without lawyers&#151;are deprived of the fruits of their independent
labor and investments. </p>

<p> Patent proponents argue that this uninhibited duplication of effort wastes
resources. But the "waste" could be cut only by reducing the number of players
and slowing the pace of development to fit the cycles of the patent system.
The result would be a handful of giants competing on a global scale, bidding 
for the ideas and loyalty of inventive individuals. </p>

<p> However, many programmers believe that there are diseconomies of scale
in software development&#151;that the best programs are authored rather than
assembled. The success of Visicalc, Lotus 1-2-3, WordPerfect, and other classic
programs testifies to the genius of individuals and small teams. Certainly
there has been no evidence that they need more incentives. Quite the contrary, 
the freewheeling U.S. software industry has been a model of creative enterprise. 

</p>
<p><h2> <a name="A Costly System" href="swpc.htm#top">A Costly System</a></h2>

<p> Even software developers and publishers who do not wish to patent their
products must bear the costs of operating under a patent system. While these
costs may initially come out of the software industry's operating margins,
in the long run, they will be borne by users. </p>

<p> At the first level is the expense of analyzing prior art to avoid patent
infringement. A precautionary search and report by outside patent counsel
can run about $2,000&#151;that's per process, not per program. </p>
<p> Next are the direct costs of the patent monopoly&#151;the license fees that
must be paid to patent holders. If the patent holder refuses to license at
a reasonable fee, developers must design around the patent, if that is possible.
Otherwise, they must reconceive or even abandon the product. </p>
<p> The third set of costs are those incurred in filing for patents. Searching
for prior art, plus preparing, filing, negotiating, and maintaining a patent,
can total $10,000 to $25,000, not including internal staff time. Seeking
foreign patents can make the bill substantially higher. </p>

<p> The notoriously high costs of patent litigation must be borne by both
sides. Just the discovery phase of a lawsuit is likely to cost each side
a minimum of $150,000, and a full trial can cost each from $250,000 to millions.
Again, these figures do not include internal staff time, which could easily
double the real cost. While a small patent holder may be able to secure a
law firm on a contingency basis or sell an interest in the patent to speculators,
the defendant has no such options. </p>

<p> Litigation also involves the possibility and further expense of an appeal.
All appealed patent cases now go directly to the <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit</a> (CAFC, successor to the CCPA), where panels in patent cases
are usually led by patent lawyers turned judges. Whereas patents once fared
poorly on appeal, the CAFC has found patents to be both valid and infringed 
in over 60 percent of the cases that have come before it. The CAFC has greatly
strengthened the presumption of patent validity and upheld royalties ranging
from 5 to 33 percent. </p>

<p> While a large software company may be able to absorb these costs, they
will disproportionately burden smaller companies. The first to suffer will
be independent developers who cannot afford to market their own products.
These developers typically receive royalties of 10 to 15 percent from publishers
who serve as their distributors. Such modest margins, out of which developers
must recoup their own costs, would be wiped out by the need to pay royalties
to a few patent holders. </p>

<p> The high costs of a patent environment give patentees considerable leverage
over small firms who will, as a practical necessity, pay a license fee rather
than contest a dubious claim. To establish credibility, the patentee will
settle for small fees from the initial licensees. The patent holder can then
move on to confront other small firms, pointing to such licensings as acknowledgments
of the patent's validity and power. This tactic has a snowballing effect
that can give the patent holder the momentum and resources to take on larger
companies. </p>

<p> Cross-licensing&#151;where firms secure patents to trade for the right to
other patents&#151;seems to work reasonably well in many industries and has been
touted as the answer to these problems. However, cross-licensing is of little
value to smaller companies, which have little to bring to the table. And
cross-licensing may prove of limited value even to large companies, since
it does not protect against companies like Refac that have no interest in 
producing software and therefore no need to cross-license. </p>

<p> Of course, the power that software patents afford may induce some venture
capitalists to invest in them. But investing in software patents is one thing;
investing in robust, complex products for a mass market is another. </p>

<p> In fact, software publishers hold very few patents. The vast majority
are held by large hardware companies, computer manufacturers that have in-house
patent counsel and considerable experience in patenting and cross-licensing.
Nearly 40 percent of the software patents that the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office now issues go to Japanese hardware companies. It is quite possible
that the separate software publishing industry may cease to exist as companies
find that they need the patent portfolios and legal resources that the hardware
giants can provide. The result will be a loss of diversity in software products,
reduced competition, and, many believe, a less productive software industry. </p>

<p><h2> <a name="Protecting Ideas and Information" href="swpc.htm#top">Protecting Ideas and Information</a></h2>

<p> A deeper, more disturbing problem in patenting programs was barely evident
before computers became ubiquitous personal tools and software became infinitely
versatile. More than a "universal machine," the computer has developed into
a medium for human expression and a mediator of human experience. Software
is designed to satisfy specific needs for shaping and delivering information.
Thus, what is increasingly at stake in software patents is the generation
and flow of information. This becomes more threatening when the claims in
a patent extend far beyond the disclosed means of implementation to cover
general ideas. </p>

<p> Broad patent claims covering abstract processes are not limited to software,
or even to computer hardware. Consider <a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4170832.html">patent no. 4,170,832</a>, granted in 1979
for an "interactive teaching machine." The patent discloses a clumsy-looking
combined videotape deck and television with a set of push buttons. </p>

<p> The patent includes a process claim for a procedure commonly used in
interactive video: showing an introductory video segment, presenting the
viewer with a limited number of choices, registering the viewer's decision,
and then revealing the likely outcome of that decision. The disclosed machine,
which was never marketed, contributes nothing to the public domain: it simply 
reveals one person's way of implementing a basic instructional technique. </p>

<p> In a notorious 1983 case, a federal district court upheld the patentability
of <a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4346442.html">Merrill Lynch's Cash Management Account system</a>, a procedure for moving
investment funds among different types of accounts. Acknowledging that the
system&#151;essentially a method of doing business&#151;would not be patentable if
executed with pencil and paper, the court nevertheless upheld the patent
because it made use of a computer. </p>

<p> The Patent Office has taken this principle one step further. Besides
granting monopolies on new procedures such as the Cash Management Account
system, the office is also awarding patents merely for automating familiar
processes such as generating footnotes (<a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4648067.html">patent no. 4,648,067</a>) and comparing
documents (<a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4807182.html">patent no. 4,807,182</a>). But software developers have been routinely 
automating such common office functions, bookkeeping procedures, learning
strategies, and modes of human interaction for years. The principle that
patents are granted to induce inventors to disclose trade secrets has no
relevance here. These processes are part of everyday life, and can and should
be computerized in a number of ways. </p>

<p> What's more, information per se is traditionally the substance and territory
of copyright. The intelligent ordering of information is the very heart of
grammar, rhetoric, and graphic design. </p>

<p> Why should information be subject to the pervasive restraints of patent
simply because it is interactive rather than linear? Should human expression
that is assembled, communicated, or assimilated with the aid of a computer
be restrained by patents? If the computer is seen as an extension of the
human mind rather than vice versa, the answer is no. </p>

<p><h2> <a name="Changing Patent Policy" href="swpc.htm#top">Changing Patent Policy</a> </h2>

<p> Software developers who understand the impact of patents are demoralized.
Lawyers assure them that patents are here to stay, and that programmers must
seek new patents to protect against other patents. These lawyers point to
the growing torrent of software patents, the presumption of patent validity,
and the fervidly pro-patent record of the Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit. Smaller companies that cannot afford this advice can only hope that
companies with deeper pockets will afford more visible and attractive targets
for patent holders bringing suit. </p>

<p> But the narrowness of the Supreme Court decision in Diamond v. Diehr
remains. The Court never explicitly rejected the traditional doctrines against
the patentability of mental steps and business methods, doctrines that may
yet defeat many of the patents that have issued. If the hue and cry grows,
Congress could amend the Patent Act to make it clear that the scope of patenting
is still limited to physical processes. </p>

<p> The software industry was not broke, but it is in the process of being
"fixed." The question is whether the fixing will be done by the gush of awards
from private proceedings in the Patent Office&#151;or by a public decision about
whether software patents serve "to promote the Progress of Science and useful
Arts," as <a href="fz/consti.htm">the Constitution</a> requires. </p>
