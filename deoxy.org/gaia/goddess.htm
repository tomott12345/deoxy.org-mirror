<strong>The later forms of her cult involved the worship of a male deity (her son or lover, e.g., <a href="goddess.htm#ADONIS">Adonis</a>, <a href="goddess.htm#OSIRIS">Osiris</a>), whose death and resurrection symbolized the regenerative power of the earth.</strong>

Since the 16th cent. it has served as a symbol of medicine; it is the insignia of the medical branch of the U.S. army.
<p>
<strong><a name="CERES">Ceres</a>,</strong> in Roman mythology, goddess of grain; daughter of <a href="goddess.htm#SATURN">Saturn</a> and Ops.

<p>
<strong><a name="CHAOS">Chaos</a>,</strong> in Greek mythology, the vacant, unfathomable space from which everything arose. In the <a href="goddess.htm#OLYMPIAN">Olympian</a> myth <a href="goddess.htm#GAEA">Gaea</a> sprang from Chaos and became the mother of all things.

<p>
<strong><a name="CYCLOPS">Cyclops</a></strong> plural of <strong>Cyclopes,</strong> in Greek mythology, immense one-eyed beings.

<p>
<strong><a name="DELPHI">Delphi</a>,</strong> town in Phocis, Greece, near the foot of Mt. Parnassus. It was the seat of the Delphic <a href="goddess.htm#ORACLE">Oracle</a>, the most famous and powerful oracle of ancient Greece. The oracle, which originated in the worship of an earth-goddess, possibly <a href="goddess.htm#GAEA">Gaea</a>, was the principal shrine of <a href="goddess.htm#APOLLO">Apollo</a>. It was housed in a temple built in the 6th cent. B.C. The oracular messages were spoken by a priestess in a frenzied trance and interpreted by a priest, who usually spoke in verse. The oracle's influence prevailed throughout Greece until Hellenistic times. Delphi was the meeting place of the Amphictyonic League and the site of the Pythian Games. It was later pillaged by the Romans, and the sanctuary fell into decay.

The Romans identified her with <a href="goddess.htm#CERES">Ceres</a>.

He was thought to be the son of either <a href="goddess.htm#ZEUS">Zeus</a> and <a href="goddess.htm#PERSEPHONE">Persephone</a> or of Zeus and Semele. Dionysus was attended by a carousing band of <a href="goddess.htm#SATYR">Satyrs</a>, <a href="goddess.htm#MAENAD">Maenads</a>, and <a href="goddess.htm#NYMPH">Nymphs</a>. He taught humans viticulture but was capable of dreadful revenge upon those (e.g., Orpheus and Pentheus) who denied his divinity. His worship was characteristically drunken and orgiastic. The chief figure in the <a href="goddess.htm#OMYSTERIES">Orphic Mysteries</a> and other cults, Dionysus had many festivals in his honor. From the music, singing, and dancing of the Greater Dionysia in Athens developed the dithyramb and, ultimately, Greek drama. The Romans identified him with Liber and <a href="goddess.htm#BACCHUS">Bacchus</a>, who was more properly the wine god.<br><center>

<p>
<strong><a name="ISIS">Isis</a>,</strong> nature goddess whose worship, originating in ancient Egypt, gradually extended throughout the lands of the Mediterranean world and became one of the chief religions of the Roman Empire.

<p>
<a name="OMYSTERIES"><strong>Orphic Mysteries</strong> or <strong>Orphism</strong></a><strong>,</strong> religious cult of ancient Greece, ascribed to Orpheus. The Orphics affirmed the divine origin of the soul, but also the dual aspect of human nature as good and evil. They believed that through initiation into the Orphic <a href="goddess.htm#MYSTERIES">Mysteries</a> and through the process of transmigration, <img src="eyefood/leaf.jpg" width=50 height=72 border=0 vspace=8 hpsace=8 align="right" alt="leaf"> the soul could be liberated from its inheritance of evil and achieve eternal blessedness. Orphism followed a strict ethical and moral code and adopted practices such as Vegetarianism for purification.
<p>
<strong><a name="OSIRIS">Osiris</a>,</strong> in Egyptian Religion, legendary ruler of predynastic Egypt and god of the underworld. Osiris symbolized the creative forces of nature and the imperishability of life. Called the great benefactor of humanity, he brought to the people knowledge of agriculture and civilization. In a famous myth he was slain by his evil brother Set, but his death was avenged by his son <a href="goddess.htm#HORUS">Horus</a>. The worship of Osiris, one of the great cults of ancient Egypt, gradually spread throughout the Mediterranean world and, with that of <a href="goddess.htm#ISIS">Isis</a> and Horus, was especially vital during the Roman Empire.
<p>
<strong><a name="PAN">Pan</a>,</strong> in Greek mythology, pastoral god of fertility (god of woods, fields and flocks); worshiped principally in Arcadia. He was depicted as a merry, ugly man with a goat's horns, ears, and legs. All his myths deal with his amorous affairs. He came to be associated with the Greek <a href="goddess.htm#DIONYSUS">Dionysus</a> and the Roman Faunus, both fertility gods.
<p>
<strong><a name="PANDORA">Pandora</a>,</strong> in Greek mythology, first woman on earth. <a href="goddess.htm#ZEUS">Zeus</a> ordered her creation as vengeance on man and his benefactor, <a href="goddess.htm#PROMETHEUS">Prometheus</a>, to whose brother Epimetheus he sent her. Zeus gave her a box that he forbade her to open. She disobeyed and let out all the world's evils. Only hope remained in the box.
<p>
<a name="PERSEPHONE"><strong>Persephone</strong> or <strong>Proserpine</strong></a><strong>,</strong> in Greek and Roman mythology, goddess of fertility, queen of the underworld; daughter of <a href="goddess.htm#ZEUS">Zeus</a> and <a href="goddess.htm#DEMETER">Demeter</a>. She was abducted by Pluto, who held her captive in <a href="goddess.htm#HADES">Hades</a>. Demeter persuaded the gods to let her return to earth for eight months a year. <img src="eyefood/daisy.jpg" width=58 height=60 border=0 align="right" alt="daisy" vspace=8 hspace=8> Her story, celebrated in the <a href="goddess.htm#EMYSTERIES">Eleusinian Mysteries</a>, symbolized the vegetative cycle. When she left the earth, life withered; when she returned, it blossomed anew.
<p>
<strong><a name="POSEIDON">Poseidon</a>,</strong> in Greek religion, god of the sea, protector of all waters. Powerful, violent, and vengeful, he carried the trident, with which he caused earthquakes. He was the husband of Amphitrite and the father of many sons, most either brutal men (e.g., Orion) or monsters (e.g., Polyphemus). He was also important as Hippios, god of horses, and was the father of Pegasus. The Romans identified him with Neptune.
<p>
<strong><a name="PROMETHEUS">Prometheus</a>,</strong> in Greek mythology, <a href="goddess.htm#TITAN">Titan</a> benefactor of man, whom, in one legend, he created. He stole fire from the gods, gave it to man, and taught him many arts and sciences. In retaliation, <a href="goddess.htm#ZEUS">Zeus</a> plagued man with <a href="goddess.htm#PANDORA">Pandora</a> and her box of evils, and chained Prometheus to a mountain, where an eagle preyed on his liver. In some myths <a href="goddess.htm#HERCULES">Hercules</a> released him. Prometheus is the subject of many literary works, including Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound and Shelley's Prometheus Unbound.
<p>
<strong><a name="RHEA">Rhea</a>,</strong> in Greek mythology, a <a href="goddess.htm#TITAN">Titan</a>; wife and sister of <a href="goddess.htm#CRONUS">Cronus</a>; mother of <a href="goddess.htm#ZEUS">Zeus</a>, <a href="goddess.htm#POSEIDON">Poseidon</a>, <a href="goddess.htm#HADES">Pluto</a>, <a href="goddess.htm#HESTIA">Hestia</a>, <a href="goddess.htm#HERA">Hera</a>, and <a href="goddess.htm#DEMETER">Demeter</a>. She aided Zeus in the overthrow of Cronus. Associated with fertility, her worship was prominent in Crete. In Rome Rhea was worshiped as Magna Mater and identified with Ops.
<p>
<strong><a name="SATURN">Saturn</a>,</strong> in Roman religion, god of harvests; husband of Ops; father of Jupiter, Juno, <a href="goddess.htm#CERES">Ceres</a>, Pluto, and Neptune; identified with <a href="goddess.htm#CRONUS">Cronus</a>. After the <a href="goddess.htm#TITAN">Titan</a>s' fall, he was said to have fled to Italy, settled on the Capitoline Hill, civilized the people, and taught them agriculture. On his festival, the Saturnalia, work ceased, gifts were exchanged, and war was outlawed.
<p>
<strong><a name="SATYR">satyr</a>,</strong> in Greek myth, forest and mountain creature. Part human, with horses' tails and ears, and goats' horns and legs, they were merry, drunken, lustful devotees of <a href="goddess.htm#DIONYSUS">Dionysus</a>.
<p>
<strong><a name="TARTARUS">Tartarus</a>,</strong> in Greek mythology, lowest region of <a href="goddess.htm#HADES">Hades</a>, where the wicked, e.g., Sisyphus, Tantalus, were punished.
<p>
<strong><a name="THYRSUS">thyrsus</a>,</strong> a staff tipped with a pine cone and twined with ivy, carried by <a href="goddess.htm#DIONYSUS">Dionysus</a>, Dionysian revelers, and <a href="goddess.htm#SATYR">satyrs</a>.
<p>
<strong><a name="TITAN">Titan</a>,</strong> in Greek mythology, one of 12 primeval deities; children of <a href="goddess.htm#URANUS">Uranus</a> and <a href="goddess.htm#GAEA">Gaea</a>. They were <a href="goddess.htm#CRONUS">Cronus</a>, Iapetus, Hyperion, Oceanus, Coeus, Creus, Theia, <a href="goddess.htm#RHEA">Rhea</a>, Mnemosyne, Phoebe, Tethys, and Themis. Their descendants, e.g., <a href="goddess.htm#PROMETHEUS">Prometheus</a>, <a href="goddess.htm#ATLAS">Atlas</a>, <a href="goddess.htm#HECATE">Hecate</a>, <a href="goddess.htm#HELIOS">Helios</a>, were also called Titans. Led by Cronus, they deposed Uranus and ruled the universe. They were in turn overthrown by the <a href="goddess.htm#OLYMPIAN">Olympians</a>, led by <a href="goddess.htm#ZEUS">Zeus</a>, in a battle called the Titanomachy. Afterward Cronus ruled the Isle of the Blessed and <a href="goddess.htm#ATLAS">Atlas</a> held up the sky. The others, except Prometheus, who had helped Zeus, were condemned to <a href="goddess.htm#TARTARUS">Tartarus</a>.

<p>
<strong><a name="TYPHON">Typhon</a>,</strong> in Greek mythology, was the final son of <a 
href="goddess.htm#GAEA">Gaea</a>, this time with <a href="goddess.htm#TARTARUS">Gaea</a>Tartarus</a>, the offspring of 
the Earth and the cavernous void beneath.<small><sup>2</sup></small>


<p>
<strong><a name="URANUS">Uranus</a>,</strong> in Greek mythology, the heavens, first ruler of the universe; son and husband of <a href="goddess.htm#GAEA">Gaea</a>; father of <a href="goddess.htm#TITAN">Titans</a>, <a href="goddess.htm#CYCLOPS">Cyclops</a>, and Hundred-handed Ones. Uranus was castrated and dethroned by <a href="goddess.htm#CRONUS">Cronus</a>. His blood, falling onto Earth, produced the vengeful <a href="goddess.htm#FURIES">Furies</a>; from his discarded flesh and the sea <a href="goddess.htm#APHRODITE">Aphrodite</a> arose.
<p><img src="eyefood/venus1a.jpg" width=210 height=100 hspace=12 vspace=12 border=0 align="right" alt="Venus">
<strong><a name="VENUS">Venus</a>,</strong> in Roman religion, goddess of vegetation; identified from the 3d cent. B.C. with the Greek <a href="goddess.htm#APHRODITE">Aphrodite</a>. In imperial times she was worshiped as Venus Genetrix, mother of Aeneas; Venus Felix, bringer of good fortune; Venus Victrix, bringer of victory; and Venus Verticordia, protector of feminine chastity. Among the famous sculptures of the goddess are the Venus of Milo (Louvre) and the Venus of Medici (Uffizi, Florence).
<p>
<strong><a name="ZEUS">Zeus</a>,</strong> in Greek religion, supreme god; son of <a href="goddess.htm#CRONUS">Cronus</a>, whom he succeeded, and <a href="goddess.htm#RHEA">Rhea</a>; brother and husband of <a href="goddess.htm#HERA">Hera</a>. After the overthrow of the <a href="goddess.htm#TITAN">Titan</a>s, when lots were cast to divide the universe, the underworld went to <a href="goddess.htm#HADES">Hades</a>, the sea to <a href="goddess.htm#POSEIDON">Poseidon</a>, and the heavens and earth to Zeus. An amorous god, he loved goddesses, <a href="goddess.htm#NYMPH">nymphs</a>, and mortals, and fathered many children. Ruling from his court on Mt. Olympus, Zeus was the symbol of power, rule, and law; the rewarder of good; and the punisher of evil. Also the god of weather (his most famous weapon was the thunderbolt) and fertility, he was worshiped in connection with almost every aspect of life. The Romans equated Zeus with their own supreme god, Jupiter.</blockquote>
