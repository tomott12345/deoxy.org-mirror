<h2>The Human Evasion <font size="+1">by <a href="http://www.celiagreen.com">Celia Green</a></font><p>
<font size="+1"><a name="1">Chapter 2 : The Characteristics of Sanity</a></font><br></h2>

Sanity may be described as the conscientious denial of reality. That
is to say, the facts of the situation (apart from a few which are
judged to be harmless) have no emotional impact to a sane mind.
<p>
For example, it is a salient feature of our position that we are in a
state of <i>total uncertainty</i>. Possibly the universe started with a
"big bang" a few aeons ago, or perhaps something even more incredible
happened. In any case, there is no reason known to us why everything
should not stop existing at any moment. I realize that to my sane
readers I shall appear to be making an empty academic point. That is
precisely what is so remarkable about sanity.
<p>
The sane person prides himself on his ability to be unaffected by
important facts, and interested in unimportant ones. He refers to this
as having a sense of perspective, or keeping things "in proportion".
<p>
Consider the wife of the Bishop of Woolwich. She says&#151;I have
sometimes been asked recently: "What effect has <i>Honest to God</i> and all
the reaction to it had on your children?"<font size="-2"><sup><a href="2.htm#2.1">1</a></sup></font>
<p>
That is to say, what effect has it had on her children that their
father has written a book about the nature of reality which has
attracted a great deal of attention. Have they become interested in
their father's importance as a possible influence on the course of
history? Have they started to take themselves seriously and determined
to influence their generation? Or have they begun to take a precocious
interest in theology, whether agreeing or disagreeing with their
father? The Bishop's wife assures us that none of these unpleasant
things have happened. What effect, then, <i>has</i> it had? "The simple
answer is&#151;practically none at all," she says. "Life goes on much as
it did before." The vital questions continue to be "Do you have to go
out tonight?", "What can I wear for the party?", and "What's for
supper?"
<p>
This ability to keep things "in perspective", or upside down, is
beautifully exemplified by certain remarks made by the aging Freud.
<p>
Seventy years have taught me to accept life with a cheerful
humility....
<p>
Perhaps the gods are kind to us in making life more disagreeable as we
grow older. In the end death seems less intolerable than the manifold
burdens we carry.... I do not rebel against the universal order....
(Asked whether it meant nothing to him that his name should live)
Nothing whatsoever.... I am far more interested in this blossom than
in anything that may happen to me after I am dead.... I am not a
pessimist, I permit no philosophic reflections to spoil my enjoyment
of the simple things of life.<font size="-2"><sup><a href="2.htm#2.2">2</a></sup></font>
<p>
To appreciate the full force of these remarks one must realize that
Freud had already had five operations for cancer of the jaw, and was
in more or less continuous pain. (It may be held that when Freud
looked at a blossom and found it more interesting than pain and death
and fame, this was because he was overcome by the astonishing fact
that the blossom existed at all. But if this were so, I think he would
scarcely refer to it as one of the "simple" things of life.)
<p>
He was not entirely immune from reminders of his finite condition, as
is shown by other statements which he made at various times.
<p><blockquote>
... there is deep inside a pessimistic conviction that the end of my
life is near. That feeds on the torments from my scar which never
cease.<font size="-2"><sup><a href="2.htm#2.3">3</a></sup></font>
<p>
When you at a youthful 54 cannot avoid often thinking of death you
cannot be astonished that at the age of 80 1/2 I fret whether I shall
reach the age of my father and brother or further still into my
mother's age, tormented on the one hand by the conflict between the
wish for rest and the dread of fresh suffering that further life brings
and on the other hand anticipation of the pain of separation from
everything to which I am still attached.<font size="-2"><sup><a href="2.htm#2.4">4</a></sup></font> The radium
has once more begun to eat in, with pain and toxic effects, and my world
is again what it was before -- a little island of pain floating on a sea of
indifference.<font size="-2"><sup><a href="2.htm#2.5">5</a></sup></font>
<p></blockquote>
However, in spite of all this he didn't lose interest in trivia, and
in the eyes of any sane person this establishes his claim to possess
great "emotional stability".
<p>
Seeing things in perspective usually means that you stand at a certain
distance away from the objects of observation. The "perspective" in
which a sane person lives depends on avoiding this manoeuvre. You have
to hold a flower very close to your eyes if it is to blot out the sky.
The sane person holds his life in front of his face like someone with
short sight reading a newspaper with rather small print. It follows
that he cannot have emotions about the universe, because he cannot see
that it is there.
<p>
This is a salient feature of sanity&#151;it does not include emotions
about the universe. Some sane readers may object: "Once I was excited
about anti-particles for several hours", or "I tried out solipsism for
three whole days".
<p>
So, if it is insisted upon, we may qualify this statement as follows:
Sanity may occasionally allow transitory emotions about the universe or
reality, but it does not allow them to exercise any perceptible
influence as motives in the life of the individual. At this stage in
our argument we must regard it as an open question whether this is an
accidental by-product of sanity, or whether it is the deliberate but
unstated objective at which all sane psychology is aimed.
<p>
I must explain what I mean by an emotion about the universe&#151;since
this is an unfamiliar and bizarre phenomenon&#151;so let me give an
example. Ludwig Wittgenstein, the founder of linguistic philosophy,
which has made so great a contribution to intellectual sanity in this
century, was himself not quite so sane as he would have liked. Indeed,
it may be argued that linguistic philosophy was itself the product of
his strenuous attempts to remain sane enough. A case of an irritated
oyster producing a pearl&#151;the sane may reply&#151;which does not detract
from the value of the pearl. Possibly.
<p>
But it is undeniable that Wittgenstein did occasionally have emotions
about the universe. So his biographer records: "I believe that a
certain feeling of amazement that <i>anything should exist at all</i>, was
sometimes experienced by Wittgenstein.... Whether this feeling has
anything to do with religion is not clear to me."<font size="-2"><sup><a href="2.htm#2.6">6</a></sup></font>
<p>
Notice in passing the fastidiousness with which his biographer hastens
to disclaim any exact comprehension of this feeling. ("I believe the
lower classes eat fish and chips from newspaper. Whether this practice
has anything to do with nutrition is not clear to me.")
<p>
What more can be said of the sane person? He is ubiquitous, and so his
characteristics are invisible. There is nothing to compare him with.
<p>
But let us consider the picture given in a jolly little booklet called
<i>A <i>positive</i> approach to Mental Health.<font size="-2"><sup><a href="2.htm#2.7">7</a></sup></font></i> (The cover
is adorned with a picture of a happy fakir sitting beside an abandoned bed
of nails.)
<p>
"How does the person who is enjoying good mental health think and
act?" the booklet asks, and proceeds to inform us, among other things,
that "He gets satisfaction from simple, every-day pleasures." Freud,
you see, certainly qualified.
<p>
"He has emotions", the booklet also informs us, "like anyone else."
However, they are "in proportion" and he is not "crushed" by them. I
think by now we have established what is meant by keeping things "in
proportion"&#151;i.e. you have most of your emotions about unimportant
things. The booklet does not state this explicitly, but it certainly
does not state anything to the contrary. It might, for example, be
said that "the mature man is not unduly interested in matters of
purely local significance, such as the state of affairs on this
particular planet, because he realizes that they are of little
ultimate significance." You will observe how outlandish that sounds.
<p>
The booklet becomes a little lightheaded when it comes to the matter
of the mentally healthy person's interest in facts. "He's open-minded
about new experiences and new ideas." A more accurate statement might
be "A mentally healthy person has made a value judgement in advance
that no idea or experience can be qualitatively more important than
those he already understands. He is able to rely on his defense
mechanisms and can listen with a bland expression to people with
unpleasant ideas."
<p>
How does the mentally healthy person feel about his limitations? "He
feels able to deal with most situations that come his way.... He tries
for goals he thinks he can achieve through his own abilities; he
doesn't want the moon on a silver platter." That is to say, he has so
arranged his life that he doesn't try to do anything that doesn't seem
pretty easy. "If he can't change something he doesn't like, he adjusts
to it." "He knows he has shortcomings and can accept them without
getting upset." That is, he has ways of pretending he does not mind
about anything he cannot alter easily.
<p>
And how does he feel about other people? Here a slightly threatening
note of reciprocity appears. "He is tolerant of others shortcomings
just as he is of his own. He doesn't expect others to be perfect,
either." "He expects to like and trust other people and assumes that
they will like him.... He doesn't try to push other people around and
doesn't expect to be pushed around himself." Let us just imagine what
might have been said instead -- I know it will sound like the wildest
fantasy. "He regrets his own shortcomings and is always willing to
admire people with greater virtues and capacities than his own. He
wishes to help other people, particularly those with higher aims and a
more intense sense of purpose than he has himself. He does not expect
to be liked in return for his help."
<p>
We have established that the mentally healthy person isn't going to
let his life, with all its content of simple pleasures, be pushed
around by anyone.
<p>
This, if you give it a moment's thought, ensures that all his
relationships must be characterized by mutual purposelessness. If you
once admit a purpose to the situation, it may make differential
demands on different people.
<p>
Nevertheless, the sane person "is capable of loving other people and
thinking about their interests and well-being. He has friendships that
are satisfying and lasting. He can identify himself with a group, feel
that he is part of it, and has a sense of responsibility to his
neighbours and fellow men."
<p>
Notice that a friendship should be satisfying -- i.e. it is an end in
itself, and not a means to an end. It should also be "lasting".
Obviously if the friendship depended on community of purpose, it might
be outgrown.
<p>
So it is plain that people constitute a rather large part of the
mentally healthy person's world, but that all associations of persons
have to be characterized by a mutual sacrifice of purposiveness.
<p>
I am reminded of the porcupines of Schopenhauer. They wanted to huddle
together to keep one another warm, but found that their spines pricked
one another. If they kept too far apart, they became cold again. So
they established a distance at which they could keep one another warm
without actually making contact with one another's spines. "This
distance was henceforward known as decency and good manners."
<p>
The attitude of the mentally healthy person towards other people might
be stated as follows: "He expects to derive warmth from his proximity
to other people. He does not expect to derive anything else, and is
willing to let other people derive warmth from him so long as they,
too, abandon their prickly claims to possess needs of any other kind."
<p>
Before we leave this little booklet, let us consider that brilliant
expression "mental health". It is, of course, a social euphemism of
the same genre as "rodent operative" and "cleansing official". It
saves sane people from embarrassment by permitting them to say that
their confined and extraordinary relatives are not <i>mad</i> but "mentally
ill" or even "mentally unwell". It implies that the human mind grows
<i>naturally</i> and by <i>biological necessity</i> into the image and likeness
of the Human Evasion, as the human body grows to a certain specified
kind of shape. It implies that any deviation from the Human Evasion is
the same kind of thing as a tumour or a running sore. It sanctifies
the statistical norm. "Mental disease", the booklet says, "doesn't
indicate lack of brain power but rather a malfunctioning of the brain
and emotions. The individual just doesn't respond to various
situations <i>the way a normal person would</i>" (my italics).
<p>
What can we add to this picture of the sane? One sane opinion. "... if
I could spend the course of everlasting time in a paradise of varied
loveliness, I do not fancy my felicity would be greatly impaired if
the last secret of the universe were withheld from me."<font size="-2"><sup><a href="2.htm#2.8">8</a></sup></font>
<p>
This opinion was held by a Gifford Lecturer in the 1930s. His lectures
were entitled "The Human Situation", and they are a marvel of sanity
from beginning to end. But they are outdated in one respect. We do not
talk any more about "the human situation". The phrase implies that
humans can be seen in relation to something other than humans. What we
talk about now is sociology. Everyone is very proud of this fact. It
is the quintessence of sanity.
