Right now, there are so many conflicting sources of information
regarding the nature of reality that anybody who isn't thinking for
themselves (by now) is probably losing their minds. Historically, wars have
been fought over territory. Here in the Information Age, the human mind is
the new turf and battle strategies are being designed at this very moment
to destroy, maim, claim, and/or govern as many personal noggins as
possible. So, my friends, hold on to your trick tophats... a human mind is
a terrible thing to waste.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The new martial, info-disciplines will train INFO-Warriors to tolerate
greater doses of uncertainty so as to minimize the immobilizing tendencies
of settling down into Pat, Easy Answers. INFO-Assassins of the Mass Media,

<a name="ha" href="geoman.htm#top"><h2>HUNGRY ALIENS</h2></a>
<p>
    Aeons ago, in the lost era of our Ancient Heritage, ALIEN SPACE BEINGS
arrived and impregnated our planet with the seeds of their future harvest.
They were Aliens because they are not originally from this planet. They
were Space as they were extremely intelligent. They were Beings as long as
they held conscious intention, which they did. As interdimensional
shapeshifters, Alien Space Beings travelled between the third, fourth, and
fifth dimensions; changing form to adapt to the diverse survival conditions
of their daily lives. They elected a council of spirit farmers to be
responsible for feeding and nurturing their interstellar family. Spirit
farming entailed the locating of a biologically responsive planet and the
planting of spirit seed inside suitable neuro-muscular organisms to
eventually produce a non-stop crop of spiritual food. Since Alien Space
Beings were essentially immaterial spiritual entities, their survival
depended on certain high-frequency, vibratory substances.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Before their arrival, PLANET MIRTH was a wild, overgrown oceanic garden
teeming with multitudinous species of flora, insectoids, reptiles and
primate mammalia. It was with the latter that Alien Space Beings grafted
their spirit seed into for synthesizing a hybrid now called, "human being."
Over the millennia, Planet Mirth has since been renamed "Earth" to identify
itself as an interstellar agricultural center. Its purpose was the
production of enough spiritual food to assure the survival and evolution of
the Alien Space Beings. Like any other crop, this one required certain
culturing processes before it could be harvested.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    With their advanced tuning systems, Alien Space Beings amplified the
communications network connecting our planetary entity, its closest star
and the galactic core for optimum informational exchange. The activation of
this trinary intergalactic circuit released enough essential nutrients for
catalyzing the growth of human cultures around the planet's surface.
Through numerous stages of human evolution, these cultures grew into
civilizations by constant interaction with the planetary entity. A few,
like Atlantis, Lemuria and Egypt, outlasted the rest but eventually
collapsed to fulfill the Earth's interstellar, agricultural function. The
ripening of the alien spirit crop always paralleled the individual human
shift from a vertically-stable spiritual orientation to a more
horizontally-active material identification.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As soon as vertical internal reliance was replaced by complete
horizontal dependency, a human being lost its soul. This soul, along with
countless others, was assimilated into the alien harvest. The greatest
harvest always followed the crest and downfall of a civilization; the
larger the civilization, the greater the yield. Every twenty-four thousand
years or so, Alien Space Beings celebrated the sweetest, most abundant
harvest of them all. In astrological terms, this occurred at the end of
every Piscean Age whereby human evolution revolved almost entirely around
elaborate forms of religion-worship: producing vast horizontal feeding
frenzies called "Holy Wars." This time was referred to, by Alien Space
Beings, as The Great Collapse and it was always a time of tremendous human
sacrifice and massive suffering. It was during The Great Collapses that the
compassionate intelligence of the planetary limbic system also underwent
its most profound development.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As the Earth's largest civilizations were inadvertantly yet routinely
preparing for the next Great Collapse, the planetary entity busied Herself
with new expressions of Her boundless love. Over the millennia, She grew
increasingly aware of a handful of human beings that chose to remain true
to their vertical, spiritual orientation rather than lose their souls in
another horizontal, spiritual catastrophe. Through the rise and fall of Her
world cultures, She assessed that perhaps eleven percent of Her human crop
remained vertically loyal to Her. This geomantic, micro-culture selected to
derive its stability, strength, wisdom and morality from direct resonant
relationship with the Earth. These humans, She felt, were not destined to
become food for the Alien Space Beings but deserved to be born as baby gods
from the womb of Her omni-directional consciousness.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As part of Her evolutionary imperitives, the planetary entity was
preparing to relay a new signal to the Alien Space Beings regarding Her
service as an interstellar garden. She was also ready to communicate pure
gratitude to the Alien Space Beings for allowing the deepening love of Her
children. To propel this transmission it was necessary to locate and train
certain human midwives to birth Her baby gods. Each midwife had two parts -
one negatively charged and the other, positive - one human woman and one
human man. These humans were selected from the geomantic micro-culture and
for the high-frequency, electromagnetic charge oscillating between them. In
other words, only certain men and certain women were able to contain and
direct the Earth's energy, appropriately.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Most often, these select men and women started out with only the
faintest notion of what was happening and why they really met. They would,
however, inevitably realize their experience was set apart from the rest of
the human population by their reluctance to Fall In Love, Get Married, Have
Babies and Buy Furniture. This didn't mean they didn't try to do these
things. It's just that these cultural definitions of coupling failed to
contain the intensities required to birth the baby gods within them.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The physical fate of planet Earth gathered momentum by spinning
through deep space, following the trajectory of its orbit around its
closest star. The planetary entity expressed its spiritual destiny by what
and how it chose to develop on the way there. As part of Her destiny, She
arranged for meetings between certain men and women by awakening in them an
awareness of their shared fate. She also subjected each man and woman
separately, yet simultaneously, to certain shocks, to open and prepare them
for the Intensive Care Unit, where these three operations took place:
<p><center>

<p>
    The planetary entity prepared Her midwives by instructing them to
perform these three operations ON PURPOSE. Each man and woman learned to
recognize her instruction by the repeat appearance of multiple coincidence
surrounding each lesson. As the midwives executed each operation, the
frequency of multiple coincidence accelerated. By the stabilizing influence
of Earth Surrender Rites, midwives were able to regain placement and
navigate through the turbulence of quickened coincidence, or synchronicity.
Once the commotion settled down and synchronicity became the Standard Time
Zone, the planet went into labor.
<p>
<strong>The Planet Earth Is In Labor AND We Are The Mid-Wives</strong>
<p>
<a name="rs" href="geoman.htm#top"><h2>REALITY SELECTION</h2></a>
<p align=right>
<strong>"Chance favors the prepared mind..."</strong>
<p>
    The planetary entity and its human inhabitants are, for the most part,
not on speaking terms any more. This is partially due to the accumulation
of an excessive, static "grey noise" generated by the unavoidable side-effects
of a mechanistic Industrial Age. Its pervasive electro-chemical
pollution has all but buffered humans from the direct resonant relationship
normally affording their sense of placement as planetary midwives. This
story conveys certain attempts at establishing communications between the
planetary entity and its human inhabitants during the Great Collapse of
1987-92, a highly critical stage of their mutual future history.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The communication style of the planetary entity is broad-band,
multiple frequency transmission. Its modus operandi is not unlike a
high-powered, broadcast radio-satellite simultaneously transmitting
multiple messages. Now, as a rule, most human minds can usually permit
one thought or concept at a time. The occasional irregularity emerges with
those minds willing and able to permit enough uncertainty to beget an
awareness of multiplicity. This presupposes a recognition of and
participation in a multidimensional reality wherein all dimensions are
equally valid aspects of a greater changing whole. Preference for one level
over another, at any given time and/or space, is a matter of personal
style. If there was a name for this multi-purpose brain function it might
be:<blockquote>
<font size="+1">Reality Selection...a prerequisite for hearing the<br>
multi-vocal planetary entity.</font></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As humans endure the multi-faceted awareness of simultaneously
converging information sources, they learn to dial and fine tune those
frequencies appropriate to the concerns of the time and place they are in.
With persistence, the development of a reality selection circuit (in the
Central Neural System) encourages High-Velocity Interaction with other
humans by virtue of tolerance. (As humans distinguish and qualify various
levels within their own being, they tend to tolerate internal contraries
thus, vicariously allow for differences in others).
<p align=center><big><big>
Tolerance of differences<br>
minimizes inertia<br>
by maximizing flow.</big></big>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    By allowing for the unpredictability of simultaneous truths, certain
humans start growing more receptive to signals beyond the realm of their
own minds. It is here in the Concept-Free Zones where humans can unwrap
their high-frequency antennae from self-preoccupation and direct it towards
each other.. and down to the planetary entitiy.. on up to the stars and..
beyond. Perhaps, humans may be free to restore their service to the
planetary entity and eventually establish membership in an intergalactic
federation of vertically-stable Alien Space Beings.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In addition to its own indigenous voices and frequency shifts, the
Earth is a local resonant conductor for non-local, extraterrestrial
transmissions. Alien Space Beings and other interstellar entities broadcast
messages via <a href="meme/DNA.html">DNA</a>, the native language of the Planetary Entity.
Consequently, these signals traverse throughout all living forms on Earth.<a href="gaia/index_gm.htm" target="_top"><img align="right" src="gaia/eyefood/earth13.jpg" width=200 height=203 border=0 alt="" vspace=30></a>
Those humans awakening to the ongoing dialogue between their individual
Central Neural Systems (CNS) and their originating DNA coils are now
subject to intergalactic influences. Eighty-nine percent of the human
population is unable to tolerate the impact of such direct spiritual
transmission, so the socio-moral inertias of religions and/or
philosophical grids have been superimposed to slow things down.
<p>
<font size="+1">This same CNS/DNA interaction is known by many names as each culture
assigns their own conceptual bias to this universal truth, i.e., Jesus and the Christ.. 
Guatama and the Buddha.. but more specifically.. a Human Being and the Planetary Entity.</font>

Here's an Indian Bedtime Story. The current Hell Cycles began when the
White Minds crossed the Great Waters and anchored on the Land of the
Red-Hearted Ones. There they met, broke and defeated the Red Hearts. Blood
was spilled and heads, they rolled. Thirteen hundred moons later, the Souls
of the dead Red Hearted warriors reincarnated as the newborn of the White
Minds. These new Red-Hearted Souls were recognized by the Red-Hearted Ones
of that time by the way they dressed and wore their hair to look like the
Red-Hearted. The first wave brought the "hippies" who marked the beginning
of the end for the White Minded. One-hundred and thirty moons later, the
"mohawk punk fashions" signalled a new wave of Red warriors and two-hundred
and sixty moons afterwards...crystal channeling, pop shamanism and Mayan
nostalgia. This is how the Red Hearts initiated the Great Collapse and
finally defeated the White Minds. The Reds were defeated because of their
weak hearts and the Whites, their weak minds. For now we know what happens
when a people's strength grows too strong...yang turns to yin, hurly burly
hits broadway and everybody is hereafter proclaimed a Pope. Is Nothing
Really Sacred? Of course it is, my cherry blossom...of course, it was...

We are now being dreamed by those human forms who are feeding the Dreamtime
with their sleep. Humans can experience two major dream paths in their
nightmares and revelations. Nightmares feed the spirit world by the fear
they instill, vacating the human form and inviting various disembodied
spirits to eat the mind. Fear is ghostfood and death to the mind. No daring
is fatal and waking up is an act of unnatural courage. Children have
nightmares in order to wake up. By waking up inside their dreams, humans
inspire revelation and inform the dreambody of its true intention. The
dreambody can then awaken to itself by ... intentional spin.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The dreambody is your totality as human entities and every whole, no
matter how small or large, spins and generates its own measure of density
or, gravity. The hearts of all heavenly bodies are created from an
ultra-gravitational force called Love. Your willingness to surrender to its
influence ushers you through nightmare and into revelation. An unswerving
self-commitment is paramount to this initiation which intersect the
dreambody and the earthbody. As the dreambody, you can choose to be born
inside your human forms as they sleep. This way, you will not be recognized
too soon and can permeate the biological machine from within without
alerting its primitive mind to the miracle of your presence. Remember, in
the blessed realm of manifestation, gravity is not another good idea, it's
the law.

We are implying that your striving for it is getting in our way. The era of

    We interrupt this program to bring you the following Interstellar News
Update. There are now definite signs of an interstellar mythos emerging in
your planet's central neural systems, causing upset in the established,
governing minds of the Old Guard. Synapse fires and neuro-transmitter
chemical spillage have already taken its toll on the outdated circuitry of
the global brain, while world religions continue working overtime to
maintain moral odor.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Interstellar ambassadors from Pleiades claim responsibility for
stabilizing the trinary circuit of Mythic Intelligence in the human
species. Through the Entertainment Industry, Consciousness Technologies and
the camoflaged, galvanizing force of humor, these spiritual vigilantes work
unseen behind the smokescreen of this rapidly expanding socio-economic
tendency humans call the New Age Movement. It seems there is now a definite
interference established to slow down the current harvest cycle of the
Great Collapse. Keep your antennae unwrapped, as News Update remains on the
scene to give you the story first. You are stars in formation. This star
information has been brought to you by your non-local media services
courtesy of the Sirius Star System. Your local program will now resume...

mercifully little space in your human forms for a living soul.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Your passionate deification of the external planes has assured the complete
destabilization of your internal vertical connection. Since it is a

    In Lake'ch, I am another yourself. Trance mediumship has been your
planet's historical method of heralding spiritual currents into its
mainstream societies. Lightworkers are crossing the Great Channel during
this time to absorb the shock of disconnection essential for triggering
your next social mutation. Prostitution has been you planet's hysterical
method for dispersing valuable spiritual information during the more
oppressive cycles of civilization. As channelers and prostitutes alike are
both paid to give their bodies over to a foreign entity, together they form
and incubating polarity. The channeling phenomena is a side-effect of a
massive sexual crisis now resulting from the short-circuiting neo-puritan,
socio-moral programming in most central neural systems of the Western
World. On the genetic front, channeling expresses a sophisticated style of
panic often accompanying the distinct awareness of potential species
extinction. Your world is on fire and its people are looking for an exit.

Time: Sunrise, February 13, 1988<br>
Place: Ayer's Rock, Central Australia</strong></font><p>
    The sun rises, illuminating the land and the several thousand 
gather at the base of the sacred, ochra-red mountain. Here, whites and
aborigines alike prepare together for a sunrise ceremony, collecting wood for
the large fire started earlier. Some aboriginal tribal members are climbing
the mountain alone. Others remain behind making offerings to Darama, the
Great Spirit, through the non-stop buzzing drones of their dijeridoos..their
dead, termite-hollowed trees converted into musical instruments.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The white people have arrived from many parts of the world and are, for
the most part, dressed in bright festive colors. Many aboriginies are dressed
in white people's clothes except for those playing dijeridoos and others
climbing the mountain. These are nude or half-dressed, painted in the
traditional aboriginal x-ray style...skeleton style...bright, white spots and
streaks...across dark, moving bodies.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The metallic humming of dijeridoos and the click-clack clapping of
clapsticks infuse the air with the trance of the aboriginal dreamtime.
Everyone here is busy learning their place. The whites are learning the ways
of the aborigine. The aboriginals are learning the law of the mountain. The
mountain is absorbing the interstellar beam of galactic information now
arriving direct from the galaxy's core at twenty-seven degrees Sagittarius.
Deep inside the red mountain's cool hollow heart, a large electric-blue
crystal recieves and refracts this cosmic signal...radiating it out the the
aboriginal people climbing its skin...who, in turn, move the trembling light
around the planet's surface.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Meanwhile, back at the foot of Ayer's Rock, thousands of whites and
blacks gather around to hear the invocation of a chief aboriginal elder.
"This is the working of the ceremony to save the green ants, the aboriginal
people and the dreamtime that holds the world together. The white people are
too young to know this and too old to understand. Yet, you must listen to
these words now and hear with your hearts, the singing of the mountain. The
mountain sings. It sings like it has never sung before...it is singing now
for you...for us...for every living creature on this beautiful Earth. The
mountain sings its first and last song. The music comes from far, far away
yet it is inside you...inside the mountain...inside the trees...inside the
rising sun...inside the stars...inside the little pebbles in the river...
inside the kangaroo...inside the green ants...inside your mother...inside
your father...the song is singing by itself inside every living thing. Now,
the mountain sings to keep the world alive. When you hear the song inside
your hearts, sing back to the mountain. Sing back to the mountain...sing back
to the mountain..."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    To the backdrop soundtrack of a hundred dijeridoos and clapsticks,
thousands of people sound a rainbow chorus of tones, chants and melodies...
cadencing into an aural patchwork of multitudinous wordless song.

    Groups of three, six, nine, twelve and thirteen are required to
activate reciprocal collective engagement with the planetary entity. The
three-fold intention of the EarthSurrenderRites are: 1) stabilization of
a group mind 2) the connection of a stable group mind with its vertical
source of vitality in the Earth and Stars and 3) to instruct a vertically-
onnected stable group mind towards the balancing of Earth energies
oscillating between the planet's core and its surface. The third
intention is realized by the virtue of the previous two states requiring
absolute surrender to the Earth. It is the planetary entity that instructs
a group mind in the task of intermediating its core and surface forces
towards optimum geomantic alignment.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    By engaging vertical stability, a group mind may effectively bypass the
horizontal and social tendency to feed off each other's personal vitality.
Instead, a true group unity may emerge from each individual's total
commitment to their own internal spiritual sources and the expression of
this integrity outwardly as a state of offering. A mutual autonomy develops
with each individual's transmission of Being which, in turn, accelerates
the group mind's lowest common denominator of Intelligence. Everything that
rises must converge.

    There is no finer recreational refuge for the Divinely Inclined than to
temporarily incarnate amidst the freshly charged interactions of soulmates.
Privileged employees of the Supreme Being have been taking advantage of
this extraordinary opportunity for aeons by surfing the benevolent
turbulence of coinciding wave forms accompanying the initial stages of
recognition between reincarnated lovers. The tremendous rejuvenational
properties of Wave-Form Surfing has allowed Ascended Masters everywhere the
essential continuity for long-term spiritual maintainance while infusing
cosmic guidance along the way. It has been a favorite Holy Water sport for
such honored illuminaries as Jesus Christ, Meher Baba, the host of
Archangels, Guatama Buddha and countless other Heart-centered Teachers of
the Inner Light.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In conjunction with the Planetary Entity, many Ascended Masters have
agreed to transfer any spiritual information necessary to the survival of
the human species up to and including the year 2012 AD, by way of soulmate
interactions. In the midst of their coinciding wave forms, soulmates
undergo an initial resistance natural to the impact of profound mutual
recognition. There is an immediate energetic acceleration threatening
anything of a lesser truth in their current lives. Occasionally, they will
attempt to stabilize their shocked mortal coils by repeating familiar,
past-life karma...replicating previous mistakes and confusing them with
present time evolutionary imperitives.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It is for this very reason that the Ascended Masters have agreed to
surf the converging wave forms and energy swells emergent to these initial
shocks. The spiritual instructions necessary to navigate over great forces
can then be implemented while giving indescribable joy to the Masters. It
remains critical to these human beings to realize what they are meeting for
in their current incarnation, especially now during the immensity of the
Great Collapse harvest cycles. Most of them haven't a clue due to the
novelty bestowed by complete saturation of their rapture circuits.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Only those who have discovered and surpassed ecstacy as a goal are
privileged to cross it as a bridge into the post-survival realms of Life
After Bliss. Here, the playful arts of ceremonial magick align the two
coinciding wave forms with the Planetary Entity and thus, activate the
trinary circuit of Man/Woman/Planet. Then, the party is over for the
Ascended Masters who gracefully depart to their next celebratory calling.

    Due to the internal masculine force of a woman and the internal
feminine force of a man, the former carries a greater positive charge and
the latter, a greater negative. The positive force is gold, radiant and
cardinal. The negative force is silver, magnetic and fixed. The positive
force of a woman offers as outgoing source of vital energy for the man to
concentrate, contain and direct into creative activity. The woman is always
closer to Life than the man, as the man is always closer to Death. As man
and woman enter communion, they come to know how Life and Death are one.
The spiritual function of the man is to bring the woman to Life as it is
the woman's love that kills the man to help him grow with an awareness of,
and responsiveness to, his Death. Thus, a man and woman recollect their
placement.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As the mutual coincidence of positively and negatively charged wave
forms include the Planetary Entity into their combined awareness, a
resonant phase shift occurs in the woman. As a man and woman awaken to
their functions as conduits for the Earth's transmission, the Planetary
Entity reclaims its positive, cardinal role as primary energy source while
the woman serves its expression as a neutral, mutable distributor of EARTH
ENERGY. In this way, a woman kills a man to bring him to the Earth.

<p>
    The Earth is a living, breathing entity that has chosen to incarnate as
this planet. Human beings inhabiting the surface of the Earth are engaged
in a reciprocal feeding process with the planetary entity. Amidst the
possibilities inherent to human interaction, there exists a certain kind of
man-woman relationship serving to generate bio-psychic energies for feeding
the planet. Not every man or woman is meant to function in this capacity.
Through a series of synchronized events, planetary intelligence arranges
for certain men and women to meet for the ritual function of its feeding.
Who these men and women are, and how they nourish the planet is a primary
expression of a certain kind of ceremony.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Within each human being, there lives a "genetic conduit" for absorbing,
integrating, and transmitting signals from the DNA matrix. Besides
articulating the genetic blueprint of Life As We Know It here on Earth, DNA
is also the native language of the planetary entity. The DNA code is binary
in structure as its signals traverse between polarities to generate and
maintain life itself. Humans developing internal resonance with DNA
surrender to planetary intelligence and become conduits for its absorbtion,
integration, and transmission. The man-woman relationship required for
feeding the planet is not based on personal gratification or the mutual
romance of personalities but the possibility of becoming instrumental to
planetary service. Through cultivating profound states of receptivity, men
and women learn to detect genetic/generic patterns of being, those which
are innate to the bio-psychic structures maintaining our lives.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When the planetary entity coordinates meetings with a certain man and a
certain woman to feed itself, there is an excited intensity that is not
emotional in origin yet the emotions may react to it. This intensity is
electromagnetic in nature and generates between the genetic conduits
previously awakened in a man and a woman. There is an all-encompassing,
self-enveloping quality to this intensity. It may have the effect of
exciting tension in the physical body until the body knows what to do with
the energy. This quality will release the depth-feeling of infinity shard
between the man and woman as time dissolves and spiritual presence expands.
A certain freedom of being or mutual autonomy tends to accompany this
intensity.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    From a psychic perspective, humans are bio-electromagnetic batteries
and the planet is a geo-electromagnetic battery. Humans recharge theirs by
distinguishing and assimilating polarity within themselves. The purpose of
setting up internal polarities is igniting an oscillation of consciousness
between them towards the construction of an energetic source, or star. This
process of polarization births a third "transcendent" quality which feeds
the genetic conduit. This third point beyond polarity is pure, or generic,
consciousness and its expansion is expressed as the intensity felt between
a man and a woman during this ceremony. When two energetic sources, or
stars, generate more consciousness between them we have a "stellar
polarity" forming the larger generator from which the planetary food is
produced.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When the intensity between a man and a woman reaches "unbearable
proportions" the planetary food is cooked and sent down to the Earth's core
by the man. Genetically, man is more of a container as his inner essence is
more feminine and so, provides boundaries for the ritual. It is up to him
to make sure the container does not break from excess pressure from the
accumulating electromagnetic power. The man learns about timing. Good
timing happens when both man and woman are left with their integrity
intact. Poor timing occurs if one or both human batteries are short-
circuited and/or over-amped.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The woman's ritual function is with feeding the man while he feeds the
planet. As he directs the power to the Earth's core, the woman connects her
Heart Center to his with a beam of earth energy she draws up through her
sacrum. The woman's inner essence is more masculine, so she serves as the
contained by drawing up earth energy into her body and sending it to the
man through her heart. This can be accomplished by connecting the inhale
with sucking earth energy up through the base of her spine and circulating
this energy throughout her body on the exhale. The repitition of this
connected-breating cycle tends to stabilize her overall electromagnetic
flux as it renders a more manageable quality to the aura itself.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The previous description presents the underlying structure of this
process of shared intensities. Sometimes, emotional and psychological
reactions emerge in relation to this kind of intensity which often obscure
the true purpose of the meeting. This occurs, in part, from the human
culture having seeded human minds with images to help contain and direct
tremendous internal forces between sexes towards socially acceptable
conventions like Romance, Marriage, Having Babies and Buying Furniture.
This ritual is not accesible to every man and woman and so, ought not to be
contrived to suit the curiosity of friends and lovers. The set-up occurs by
planetary arrangement whereby a man and woman are brought together by the
power oscillating between their genetic conduits.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Occasionally, the intensity between two human batteries is misjudged
for human love and they enter the social convention of marriage. Planetary
food is then fed to a more "horizontal" emphasizing the fusion of the two
batteries rather than their mutual service to and recognition of the third
node of their trinary circuit, namely, the planet itself. It is often easy
to identify one's emotional/psychological reactions with the power
generated between genetic conduits and thus remain deluded about the
possible true origin of that intensity. Perhaps, a man and woman are
brought together for the sole purpose of feeding the planet and very little
else. They may meet on special occasions to work the ceremony and then, part
ways until the next time. However, if a man and woman start out feeding the
planet and then enter other areas of energetic fusion together only to
discover their capacity to feed the planet diminishing, then it becomes
self-evident what is happening. As the power leaves a certain couple, it
undoubtedly travels towards magnetizing another man and women together to
accomplish this task. This power is autonomous.. lighting and leaving on a
moments notice, spiraling into its most direct expression.<a href="hedonix.htm">[1]</a>
