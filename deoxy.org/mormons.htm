<H1>Mormons In Space<br>
<font size="-1">George Caffentzis &amp; Silvia Federici</font></H1>

<strong>Space is but Time congealed.</strong> An arrangement of Work/Life in integrated
sequences. The Earth is another Matter however. So why this urge
to get out of Earth? To simultaneously destroy it and transcend
it?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Is this capital's nasty little secret: the destruction of the
final recalcitrant Body? The in-itself of capitalist functionality,
the residue of a billion years of noncapitalist formation . .
. why should there be Mountains here, Rivers there and an Ocean
exactly here after all?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Why indeed space shuttles, space colonies mixed with such a density
of bombs, bombs and still more bombs . . . to destroy the Earth
n-times over as if to assure not the least roach existence. Why
the simultaneous attempt to re-code the chromosomes and the neural
system?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Why if not to define a truly capitalist BEING, in a purely capitalist
plasm and a final purely capitalist sequence of work events. Weightless,
formless neuro systems unwebbed and ready for infinite rewebbing.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Why if not a search for a being unprogrammed by millenia shifting
at the bottom of a ton of oxygen luging all this weight around,
this gravity against work.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Space is ultimately the obstacle of Time . . . Bergson got it
wrong . . . Luckacs too . . . capitalism is not the spatialization
of Time but rather the temporalization of Space, the dissolving
of distance, of the Just-Thereness of where we come from.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Outer space" is not Space as we know it, but a final
merging with the relations of time. It is lusted for not because
of the minerals on Mars - no more than the gold and silver in
the rivers of the Caribbean isles was - but what they can do to
you on Mars when they get you there.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is why the working class is so archaic, such a malfunctioning
machine. The early Hobbesians were only partly right: Humans are
not Machines but only poor copies of them. Their desires are too
limited and then again too wide. They have a desperation for a
housework built on a million years of non-capitalist pleasures
and pains and a revulsion of their own archaicness that is too
arbitrary.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The <em>Lebensraum</em> of <a href="audio/sigh.au">Hitler</a> was really an <em>Arbeitsraum</em> that required <a href="godholoc.htm">an immense destruction of &quot;leben&quot;</a> to achieve and then finally failed. So too with porcelain tiles 
glued on, computers in a soap opera of "You don't understand me":
the return of the space shuttle is heralded with a desperation
that you wonder at this desire for a biologically pure realm,
freed from the seasonal, diurnal and lunar cycles, airless, weightless
and open to infinite reductions.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This has always been capital's fatal attraction: its indifference
to Space. For the Here-Now disappears when your essential problem
is not what I need, desire and want now but what another needs,
desires or wants of what I need, desire or want. The Here vanishes
in an abstracted There-Here-There.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You can see capital from its space stations looking down . . .
"Those poor, slightly crazed machines! Their needs have been
so thoughtlessly defined, their sexuality is inconsiderate, and
their desires are fixed by biochemical cycles so local that they
make you want to cry! When will we finally be able to rid ourselves
of these Bodies?"
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If one tried to define the Zeitgeist breathing through the New
Right today one would be confronted with a seemingly undecipherable
puzzle. On the one side these are the spokesmen for a scientific
and technological revolution that a few years ago would have smacked
of science fiction: gene-splicing, DNA computers, time-compression
techniques, space colonies. At the same time the circles of the
New Right have witnessed a revival of religious tendencies and
moral conservatism that one would have thought was buried once
and for all with "our" Puritan Founding Fathers. Falwell's
Moral Majority is the most vocal of this return to the values
of Calvin and Cotton Mather, but by far not the only one. Wherever
you turn, Godfearing, Satan-minded groups, detemmined to reshape
the country on the model of the Puritan colonies, are sprawling
like mushrooms: Christian Voice, Pro-Family Forum, National Prayer
Campaign, Eagle Forum, Right to Life Commission, Fund to Restore
an Educated Electorate, Institute for Christian Economics. Seen
in its general contours, then, the body of the New Right seems
stretching in two opposite directions, attempting at once a bold
leap into the past and an equally bold leap into the future.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The puzzle increases when we realize that these are not separate
sects, but in more than one way they involve the same people and
the same money. Despite a few petty squabbles and a few pathetic
contortions to keep up the "pluralism" facade, the hand
that sends the shuttle into orbit or recombines mice and rabbits
is the same that is fretfully pushing for gays to be sent to the
stake and is drawing a big cross not just through the 20th, but
the l9th and 18th centuries, too.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To what extent the Moral Majority and Co. and the science futurologists
are one soul, one mission, is best seen, if not in the lives of
their individual spokesmen (though the image of the "electronic
minister" and of a President who in the same breath blesses
God and calls for stepped up nerve-gas production and the neutron
bomb are good evidence of this marriage}, then in the harmony
of intent they display when confronted with the "key issues"
of the time. When it comes to economic and political matters,
all shreds of difference drop off and both souls of the New Right
pull money and resources towards their common goals. Free-Market,
<em>laissez-faire</em> economics (for business, of course), the
militarization of the country (what is called "building a
strong military defense"), bolstering "intemal security,"
i.e., giving the FBI and CIA free rein to police our daily life,
cutting all social spending except that devoted to building prisons
and ensuring that thousands will fill them; in a word, asserting
U.S. capital's ownership of the world and setting "America"
to work at the minimum wage (or below) are goals for which all
the New Right would swear on the Bible.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A clue to understanding the double soul of the New Right is to
realise that its mixture of reactionary social policies and scientific
boldness is not a novelty in the history of capitalism. If we
look at the beginning of capital - the 16th and 17th century to
which the Moral Majority would so happily return - we see a similar
situation in the countries of the "take off." At the
very time when Galileo was pointing his telescope to the moon,
and Francis Bacon was laying the foundations of scientific rationality,
women and gays by the thousands were burnt on the stake throughout
Europe, with the universal blessing of the modernizing (sic) European
intelligentsia.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A sudden craze? An inexplicable fall into barbarism? In reality,
the witch hunt was part and parcel of that attempt at "human
perfectibility" that is commonly acknowledged as the dream
of the fathers of modem rationalism. For the thrust of the emerging
capitalist class towards the domination and exploitation of nature
would have remained a dead letter without the concomitant creation
of a new type of individual whose behavior would be as regular,
predictable and controllable as that of the newly discovered natural
laws. To achieve this purpose one had to destroy that magical
conception of the world that, e.g., make the Indians in the overseas
colonies believe that it was a sacrilege to mine the earth, or
in the heart of Europe assured the proletariat that people could
fly, be in two places at the same time, divine the future and
(most important) that on some "unlucky days" all enterprise
had to be carefully avoided. The witch hunt, moreover, ensured
the control over the main source of labor, the <em>woman's body</em>,
by criminalizing abortion and all forms of contraception as a
crime against the state. Finally, the witch hunt was functional
to the reorganization of family life, i.e., the restructuring
of reproduction that accompanied the reorganization of work on
a capitalistic basis. On the stake died the adulteress, the woman
of "ill repute," the lesbian, the woman who lived alone,
or lacked "maternal spirit" or had illegitimate children.
On the stake ended many beggars, who had impudently launched their
curses against the refusal of some "ale and bread."
For in the "transition" to capitalism it was primarily
the woman, especially the woman in rebellion, (destined to depend
on a man for her survival) who became pauperised. The fathers
of modem rationalism approved; some even complained that the state
did not go far enough. Notoriously, Bodin insisted that the witches
should not be "mercifully" strangled before being given
to the flames.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That today we find a similar situation prevailing in the USA is
an indication of the depth of capital's crisis. Always - in its
beginning as, we would hope, in its end - when uncertain of its
foundations, capital goes down to basics. At present this means
attempting a bold technological leap which on one side (at the
developing pole of production) concentrates capital and automates
work to an unprecedented degree and, on the other, consigns millions
of workers to either wagelessness (unemployment) or to employment
in intensive-labor types of jobs, paid at minimum rates, on the
model of the much acclaimed "workforce." This involves,
however, a reorganization of the process whereby labor is reproduced
- a project in which women are expected to play a most crucial
role.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The institutionalization of repression and self-discipline along
the line of the Moral Majority and the New Christian right is
today required for both ends of the working class spectrum: For
those who are destined to temporary, part-time subsistence level
of wages (accompanied by long hours of work or a perennial quest
for jobs) as well as for those who are elected to a "meaningful
wage" working with the most sophisticated equipment capital's
technologists are now able to produce. That the holy trinity of
God/Work/ Family is always crucial in times of repression is a
well-tested truth capital has never forgotten. What could be more
productive than a life of isolation, where the only relations
we have with each other are relations of reciprocal discipline:
Daddy controlling Mommy, Mommy teaching the children that life
is hard and survival problematic, neighbors getting together to
keep the neighborhood "clean," sociality shrinking to
those occasions that help us find or keep a job? And if life is
pain there is always God, in whose name you can even justify nuclear
war against the infidels who, like the rebellious Sodomites, deserve
to be wiped out from the face of the earth (even if a few of the
righteous get wiped out too). And you can even justify a nuclear
war that will wipe out yourself too: after all, what's the big
deal about life if you have already accepted to bargain cancer
for a wage, renounce all your desires and postpone your fulfillment
to another world?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Let us not be mistaken. Weinberger needs Jerry Falwell, as does
<a href="reagan.htm">Reagan</a>. From Wall Street to the Army, all capital's utopias are
predicated on an infinitesimal micropolitics at the level of the
body, curbing our animal spirits and redefining the meaning of
that famous Pursuit of Happiness that (so far at least) has been
the biggest of all constitutional lies. And Jerry Falwell is even
more needed for the development of the high-tech (computer, information,
energy, genetic) worker who - unlike those at the lower echelons
of the working class - cannot be run by the stick (in case God
failed); for the damage he can do (should he slip in his duty)
is infinitely greater, because the machines he works with are
infinitely more costly.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What the launching of high-tech industry needs mostly today is
a technological leap in the human machine - a big evolutionary
step creating a new type of worker to match capital's investment
needs. What are the faculties required by the new being our futurologists
advocate? A look at the debate on space colonies is revealing
in this respect. All agree, first of all, that the main impediment
today to the development of human colonies in space is bio-social
rather than technological, i.e., you may be able to glue the space
shuttle's tiles together but gluing the right space worker-technician
is a project that even the present genetic breathroughs are far
from having solved. An individual is needed who can:
<UL>
<LI>endure social isolation and sensory deprivation for long periods
of time without breaking down,
<LI>perform "perfectly" in an extremely hostile/alien
and artificial environment and under enormous stress,
<LI>achieve a superb control of his bodily functions (consider:
it takes an hour to shit in space!) and psychological reactions
(anger, hate, indecisiveness), our all-too-human frailties which
can be disastrous in the fragile, vulnerable world of life in
space,
<LI>demonstrates total obedience, conformity and receptivity to
commands, for there can be little tolerance for social deviations
and disagreements when the most minute act of sabotage can have
catastrophic consequences to the very costly, complex and powerful
equipment entrusted in their hands.
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Indeed, not only will the space technician have a quasi-religious
relation to his machine but he himself must become more and more
machine-like, achieving a perfect symbiosis with his computer
which, in the long nights of space, is often his only and always
his most reliable guide, his companion, his buddy, his friend.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The space worker, then, must be a highly ascetic type, pure in
body and soul, perfect in his performance, obedient like a well-wound
clock and extremely fetishistic in his mental modes. Where is
this gem most likely bred? In a fundamentalist type religious
sect. To put it in the words of biologist Garrett Harding:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What group would be most suitable to this most recent Brave New
World (the space colony)? Probably a religious group. There must
be unity of thought and the acceptance of discipline. But the
colonists couldn't be a bunch of Unitarians or Quakers, for these
people regard the individual conscience as the best guide to action.
space colonies' existence would require something more like the
Hutterites or the Mormons for its inhabitants . . . integration
could not be risked on this delicate vessel, for fear of sabotage
and terrorism. Only "purification" would do.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Not surprisingly, a few days after landing, the first space shuttle
astronauts were greeted by Elder Neal Maxwell at the Mormon Tabernacle.
'We honor tonight men who have seen God in all his majesty and
power,' he said and the 6000 member congregation responded, "Amen."
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The fight between creationism and evolutionism is just an internal
capitalist squabble as to what are the most adequate means of
control. Until our social biologists and genetic engineers - the
heros of today's scientific breakthrough - have found the means
to create a perfect robot, the whip will do, particularly in an
age still infected with the anarchic ideologies of the '60s, when
a lot of bad germs have already been implanted in children and
parents alike.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Moreover, the asceticism, self-control, the flight from the earth
and the body which is the substance of puritan teaching is the
best soil in which capital's scientific and economic plans can
flourish. Indeed, today, more consciously than ever, in its attempt
to relocate itself on safer shores, capital is embracing the dream
of all religion: <em>the overcoming of all physical boundaries,
the reduction of the individual human being to an angel-like creature,
all soul and will</em>. In the creation of the electronic/space
worker, the priest of scientific exploration-exploitation of the
universe, capital is fighting once again <em>its historic battle
against matter</em>, attempting to break at once both the boundaries
of the earth and the boundaries of "human nature" which,
in its present form, present irreducible limits that must be overcome.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The thrust to the organization of industries in space and the
dematerialization of the body go together. For the former cannot
be accomplished without the remolding of a whole nexus of needs,
wishes, desires, that are the product of billions of years of
material evolution on the planet and which up to now have been
the material conditions of bio-social reproduction - the blues,
the greens, the nipple, the balls, the hair of the anus, the texture
of oranges, beef, carrots, the wind and sea smell, the day light,
the need for physical contact, SEX!!!
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The dangers of sexuality are emblematic of the obstacles capital
encounters in the attempt to create a totally self-controlled
being, capable of spending nights and nights alone, talking just
to his computer, with his mind focused on nothing but the screen.
Can you afford to be homy or lonely in space? Can you afford to
be jealous or have a marital breakdown??
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What's the right attitude in this respect is indicated by a report
on the South Pole Station in Antarctica that ostensibly was set
up to study meteorological, astronomical and geographical conditions
at the pole, but in reality is a big center for human experimentation:
the study of human beings in conditions approaching that of space
(isolation for many months, lack of sensuous contact, etc.). This
report states:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As for sexual relations . . . all candidates were warned of the
"dangers" of sexual liaisons under the supercharged
conditions here. Celibacy was the best course... men think of
nothing but sex for the first few weeks, then it is submerged
until nearly the end of the winter. One worker reported, "You
just basically put it out of your mind. You are working all the
time; there is no privacy."
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Celibacy, AIDS, abstinence: it is the last step in a long process
whereby increasingly capital has decreased the sensuous-sexual
content of our lives and encounters with people, substituting
the mental image for the physical touch. Centuries of capitalist
discipline have gone a long way toward producing individuals who
shrink from others for fear of touch. (See the way we live our
social spaces: buses, trains, each passenger closed in its own
space, its own body, keeping well-defined, though invisible boundaries;
each person its own castle.) This physical as well as emotional
isolation from each other is the essence of capitalist cooperation.
But it - as well as the dematerialization of all forms of our
life - finds culmination in the inhabitant of the future space
colony whose success depends on his ability to become a<em> pure,
totally purified angel</em> - who does not fuck, does not require
the sensuous stimulations which are our daily nourishment on earth,
but can live by solely feeding on its self-sufficient, self-centered
will power.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Increasing the abstractness of the enemy body, reducing the person
you destroy to a blip on a video machine: this is another essential
element of death production which is likely to be the central
product of space industrialization. Indeed, electronic war can
become so abstract that unless your image is put into the video
screen you're likely to forget that you can be destroyed yourself.
The abstractness of the object of aggression is the essence of
the lesson that is being taught to fundamentalist youth, who from
an early age are told that all "deviants" are the same
- perfectly interchangeable - as equal expressions of the abstract
powers of evil.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Communism = Homosexuality = Drugs = Promiscuousness = Subversion
= Terrorism = Lesbianism = . . . = Satan. From this point of view,
all questions of "who," "what," "where"
and "when" become irrelevant: a good practice for a
politics of repression, and an excellent one for a policy of massive
nuclear destruction, which requires building a type of being who
can accept the destruction of millions of bodies as an unpleasant,
perhaps, but nevertheless necessary goal to cleanse the earth
from all social deviation and struggle - a pollution much worse
in the eyes of the fundamentalist than strontium 90.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To achieve this, a strategy of <em>systematic</em> isolation is
necessary: breaking all bonds between ourselves and others and
distancing ourselves even from our own body. The electronic church
completely dematerializes the healer, who becomes a cool image
duplicated on thousands of screens or a "personal" comment
in a letter written by a computer. One's main "feedback'
with the preacher is the monetary one: you send your money and
he begins to pray for you. If you fall back on the payments, the
prayers begin to lose their fervor until they end with the "final
notice."
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
With the electronic preacher, social relations become so abstract
that they are virtually substituted by an image: the radio-TV
sermon serves the same function as the home computer for the high
tech family: reproducing for you, in a purified-disembodied form,
the relations/experiences of which you have been deprived in day-to-day
life. They substitute dangerous - because  unpredictable - human
encounters with a gadget produced sociality that can be turned
off and shut down at will. It goes directly to the soul without
passing through the body: clean, efficient, infinitely available
at all hours of day and night. (In fact it can be recorded and
replayed whenever you want - time, too, not only space, is won!!!)
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Living with the machine, becoming like a machine: a <em>desexualized
angel</em>, moving in the interstices of the engine, perfectly
integrating work-space and life space as in the astronauts' pod,
infinitely weightless because purified of the force of gravity,
of all human desires/temptations - <A HREF="endwork.htm">the ancient refusal of work</A>
finally negated. Capital's old dream of "human perfectibility"
that loomed so prominent in the 16th and 17th century utopias,
from Bacon to Descartes, seems ready at hand. Not only can we
now answer the famous Puritan question, "What do the angels
do in heaven?" but we even know how they feel. Here it's
Wally Shirra talking: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Feeling weightless ... I don't know, it's so many things together.
A feeling of pride, of healthy solitude, of dignified freedom
from everything that's dirty, sticky. You feel exquisitely comfortable,
that's the word for it, exquisitely . . . You feel comfortable
and you feel you have so much energy, such an urge to do things,
such an ability to do things. And you work well, yes, you think
well, you move well, without sweat, without difficulty, as if
the biblical curse <em>In the sweat of thy face and in sorrow</em>
no longer exists. As if you've been born again.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
How petty life on earth seems from such heights . . . No wonder
capital is so careless with our earthly home, so eager to destroy
it - the big bang of nuclear explosion - destroying in one second
millions of tons of matter - the perfect embodiment of the victory
of the spirit over the earth-matter - as creative as the first
act of God! Big Bang Big Phallus . reduced to its pure, power-hungry
essence, fucking this rotting Earth in its god-like aspiration
to be free from all constraints. Faust in an angel/astronaut/spaceworker
face, a superman who does not need any-body, neither his own nor
another's, to have his will, not just on earth but in the universe
as well.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A society of angels, ruled by God, and motivated by purely spiritual-religious-patriotic
concerns. The adventure of space colonization will not be a "New
America" in the sense of being the dumping ground of castaways,
misfits and slaves. The need for total identification with the
work-project, total obedience, total self-discipline and self-control,
is so high that, according to NASA, even the old forms of reward
should be immediately ruled out:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
High monetary incentive should not be used for space colonization
recruiting because it attracts the wrong people. Furthermore,
it would be unhealthy for the community as well as for the individuals
concerned to make efforts to retain 'misfits' in the extraterrestrial
community. It would be healthier to return them to Earth, even
though this might seem more expensive.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Work without a wage. It is the essential capitalist utopia where
the work and repression becomes its own reward, and all the refusers
are cast out into the cold stellar night. We have finally reached
<em>their</em> limit.
