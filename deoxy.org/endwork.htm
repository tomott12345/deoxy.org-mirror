<H1>THE ABOLITION OF WORK<br><font size="+1">by Bob Black</font></H1>
<A HREF="audio/compute.au"><img align=left src="gif/workfree.gif" width=288 height=406 vspace=10 hspace=30 alt="ARBEIT MACHT FREI - WORK MAKES ONE FREE - entrance to Nazi concentration camp at Theresienstadt, Germany" border="0"></a>
<b>No one should ever work.</b>
<P>
Work is the source of nearly all the misery in the world. Almost
all the evil you'd care to name comes from working or from living
in a world designed for work. <b>In order to stop suffering, we
have to stop working.
</b>
<P>
That doesn't mean we have to stop doing things. It does mean creating
a new way of life based on play; in other words, a <i>ludic</i>
revolution. By "play" I mean also festivity, creativity,
conviviality, commensality, and maybe even art. There is more
to play than child's play, as worthy as that is. I call for a
collective adventure in generalized joy and freely interdependent
exuberance. Play isn't passive. Doubtless we all need a lot more
time for sheer sloth and slack than we ever enjoy now, regardless
of income or occupation, but once recovered from employment-induced
exhaustion nearly all of us [will] want [to] act. Oblomovism and Stakhanovism
are two sides of same debased coin.
<P>
<b>The ludic life is totally incompatible with existing reality.
So much the worse for "reality," the gravity hole that
sucks the vitality from the little in life that still distinguishes
it from mere survival.</b> Curiously&#151;maybe not&#151;all the old
ideologies are conservative because they believe in work. Some
of them, like Marxism and most brands of anarchism, believe in
work all the more fiercely because they believe in so little else.
<P>
Liberals say we should end employment discrimination. <b>I say
we should end employment</b>. Conservatives support right-to-work
laws. Following Karl Marx's wayward son-in-law Paul Lafargue <b>I
support the right to be lazy</b>. Leftists favor full employment.
Like the surrealists&#151;except that I'm not kidding&#151;<b>I favor
full unemployment</b>. Trotskyists agitate for permanent revolution.
<b>I agitate for permanent revelry</b>. But if all the ideologues
(as they do) advocate work&#151;and not only because they plan to
make other people do theirs&#151;they are strangely reluctant to
say so. They will carry on endlessly about wages, hours, working
conditions, exploitation, productivity, profitability. They'll
gladly talk about anything but work itself. These experts who
offer to do our thinking for us rarely share their conclusions
about work, for all its saliency in the lives of all of us. Among
themselves they quibble over the details. Unions and management
agree that we ought to sell the time of our lives in exchange
for survival, although they haggle over the price. Marxists think
we should be bossed by bureaucrats. Libertarians think we should
be bossed by businessmen. Feminists don't care which form bossing
takes so long as the bosses are women. Clearly these ideology-mongers
have serious differences over how to divvy up the spoils of power.
<b>Just as clearly, none of them have any objection to power as
such and all of them want to keep us working.</b>
<P>
You may be wondering if I'm joking or serious. I'm joking <i>and</i>
serious. To be ludic is not to be ludicrous. Play doesn't have
to be frivolous, although frivolity isn't triviality: very often
we ought to take frivolity seriously. I'd like life to be a game
- but a game with high stakes. I want to play <i>for keeps.</i>
<P>
<b>The alternative to work isn't just idleness.</b> To be ludic
is not to be quaaludic. As much as I treasure the pleasure of
torpor, it's never more rewarding than when it punctuates other
pleasures and pastimes. Nor am I promoting the managed time-disciplined
safety-valve called "leisure"; far from it. Leisure
is non-work for the sake of work. Leisure is the time spent recovering
from work, and in the frenzied but hopeless attempt to forget
about work many people return from vacations so beat that they
look forward to returning to work so they can rest up. The main
difference between work and leisure is that at work at least you
get paid for your alienation and enervation.
<P>
I am not playing definitional games with anybody. When I say I
want to abolish work, I mean just what I say, but I want to say
what I mean by defining my terms in non-idiosyncratic ways. My
minimun definition of work is <i>forced labor</i>, that is, compulsory
production. Both elements are essential. <b>Work is production
enforced by economic or political means, by the carrot or the
stick</b>. (The carrot is just the stick by other means.) But
not all creation is work. Work is never done for its own sake,
it's done on account of some product or output that the worker
(or, more often, somebody else) gets out of it. This is what work
necessarily is. <b>To define it is to despise it</b>. But work
is usually even worse than its definition decrees. The dynamic
of domination intrinsic to work tends over time toward elaboration.
In advanced work-riddled societies, including all industrial societies
whether capitalist or "communist," work invariably acquires
other attributes which accentuate its obnoxiousness.
<P>
Usually&#151;and this is even more true in "communist"
than capitalist countries, where the state is almost the only
employer and everyone is an employee&#151;<b>work is employment,
<i>i.e.</i>, wage-labor, which means selling yourself on the installment
plan</b>. Thus 95% of Americans who work, work for somebody (or
some<i>thing</i>) else. In the USSR or Cuba or Yugoslavia or Nicaragua
or any other alternative model which might be adduced, the corresponding
figure approaches 100%. Only the embattled Third World peasant
bastions&#151;Mexico, India, Brazil, Turkey&#151;temporarily shelter
significant concentrations of agriculturists who perpetuate the
traditional arrangement of most laborers in the last several millennia,
the payment of taxes (ransom) to the state or rent to parasitic
landlords in return for being otherwise left alone. Even this
raw deal is beginning to look good. <i><b>All</b></i><b> industrial
(and office) workers are employees and under the sort of surveillance
which ensures servility</b>.
<P>
But modern work has worse implications. People don't just work,
they have "jobs." One person does one productive task
all the time on an or-else basis. Even if the task has a quantum
of intrinsic interest (as increasingly many jobs don't) the monotony
of its obligatory exclusivity drains its ludic potential. A "job"
that might engage the energies of some people, for a reasonably
limited time, for the fun of it, is just a burden on those who
have to do it for forty hours a week with no say in how it should
be done, for the profit of owners who contribute nothing to the
project, and with no opportunity for sharing tasks or spreading
the work among those who actually have to do it. This is the real
world of work: a world of bureaucratic blundering, of sexual harassment
and discrimination, of bonehead bosses exploiting and scapegoating
their subordinates who&#151;by any rational-technical criteria -
should be calling the shots. But capitalism in the real world
subordinates the rational maximization of productivity and profit
to the exigencies of organizational control.
<P>
The degradation which most workers experience on the job is the
sum of assorted indignities which can be denominated as "discipline."
Foucault has complexified this phenomenon but it is simple enough.
Discipline consists of the totality of totalitarian controls at
the workplace&#151;surveillance, rotework, imposed work tempos, production
quotas, punching-in and -out, etc. <b>Discipline is what the factory
and the office and the store share with the prison and the school
and the mental hospital</b>. It is something historically original
and horrible. It was beyond the capacities of such demonic tators
of yore as Nero and Genghis Khan and Ivan the Terrible. For all
their bad intentions they just didn't have the machinery to control
their subjects as thoroughly as modern despots do. Discipline
is the distinctively diabolical modern mode of control, it is
an innovative intrusion which must be interdicted at the earliest
opportunity.
<P>
Such is "work." Play is just the opposite. Play is always
voluntary. <b>What might otherwise be play is work if it's forced.
This is axiomatic</b>. Bernie de Koven has defined play as the
"suspension of consequences." This is unacceptable if
it implies that play is inconsequential. The point is not that
play is without consequences. Playing and giving are closely related,
they are the behavioral and transactional facets of the same impulse,
the play-instinct. They share an aristocratic disdain for results.
The player gets something out of playing; that's why he plays.
But the core reward is the experience of the activity itself (whatever
it is). Some otherwise attentive students of play, like Johan
Huizinga (<i>Homo Ludens</i>) define it as game-playing or following
rules. I respect Huizinga's erudition but emphatically reject
his constraints. There are many good games (chess, baseball, Monopoly,
bridge) which are rule-govemed but there is much more to play
than game-playing. Conversation, sex, dancing, travel&#151;these
practices aren't rule-governed but they are surely play if anything
is. And rules can be <i>played with</i> at least as readily as
anything else.
<P>
<b>Work makes a mockery of freedom</b>. The official line is that
we all have rights and live in a democracy. Other unfortunates
who aren't free like we are have to live in police states. These
victims obey orders or-else, no matter how arbitrary. The authorities
keep them under regular surveillance. State bureaucrats control
even the smaller details of everyday life. The officials who push
them around are answerable only to the higher-ups, public or private.
Either way, dissent and disobedience are punished. Informers report
regularly to the authorities. All this is supposed to be a very
bad thing.
<P>
And so it is, although it is nothing but a description of the
modern workplace. The liberals and conservatives and libertarians
who lament totalitarianism are phonies and hypocrites. <b>There
is more freedom in any moderately de-Stalinized dictatorship than
there is in the ordinary American workplace.</b> You find the
same sort of hierarchy and discipline in an office or factory
as you do in a prison or a monastery. In fact, as Foucault and
others have shown, prisons and factories came in at about the
same time, and their operators consciously borrowed from each
other's control techniques. <b>A worker is a part-time slave</b>.
The boss says when to show up, when to leave, and what to do in
the meantime. He tells you how much work to do and how fast. He
is free to carry his control to humiliating extremes, regulating,
if he feels like it, the clothes you wear or how often you go
to the bathroom. With a few exceptions he can fire you for any
reason, or no reason. He has you spied on by snitches and supervisors;
he amasses a dossier on every employee. Talking back is called
"insubordination," just as if a worker is a naughty
child, and it not only gets you fired, it disqualifies you for
unemployment compensation. Without necessarily endorsing it for
them either, it is noteworthy that children at home and in school
receive much the same treatment, justified in their case by their
supposed immaturity. What does this say about their parents and
teachers who work?
<P>
The demeaning system of domination I've described rules over half
the waking hours of a majority of women and the vast majority
of men for decades, for most of their lifespans. <b>For certain
purposes it's not too misleading to call our system democracy
or capitalism or&#151;better still&#151;industrialism, but its real
names are factory fascism and office oligarchy. </b>Anybody who
says these people are "free" is lying or stupid. <i>You
are what you do</i>. If you do boring, stupid, monotonous work,
chances are you'll end up boring, stupid and monotonous. <b>Work
is a much better explanation for the creeping cretinization all
around us than even such significant moronizing mechanisms as
television and education</b>. People who are regimented all their
lives, handed off to work from school and bracketed by the family
in the beginning and the nursing home at the end, are habituated
to hierarchy and psychologically enslaved. Their aptitude for
autonomy is so atrophied that their fear of freedom is among their
few rationally grounded phobias. Their obedience training at work
carries over into the families they start, thus reproducing the
system in more ways than one, and into politics, culture and everything
else. Once you drain the vitality from people at work, they'll
likely submit to hierarchy and expertise in everything. They're
used to it.
<P>
<b>We are so close to the world of work that we can't see what
it does to us.</b> We have to rely on outside observers from other
times or other cultures to appreciate the extremity and the pathology
of our present position. There was a time in our own past when
the "work ethic" would have been incomprehensible, and
perhaps Weber was on to something when he tied its appearance
to a religion, Calvinism, which if it emerged today instead of
four centuries ago would immediately and appropriately be labelled
a cult. Be that as it may, we have only to draw upon the wisdom
of antiquity to put work in perspective. The ancients saw work
for what it is, and their view prevailed, the Calvinist cranks
notwithstanding, until overthrown by industrialism&#151;but not before
receiving the endorsement of its prophets.
<P>
<b>Let's pretend for a moment that work doesn't turn people into
stultified submissives.</b> Let's pretend, in defiance of any
plausible psychology and the ideology of its boosters, that it
has no effect on the formation of character. And let's pretend
that work isn't as boring and tiring and humiliating as we all
know it really is. Even then, work would <i>still</i> make a mockery
of all humanistic and democratic aspirations, just because it
usurps so much of our time. <b>Socrates said that manual laborers
make bad friends and bad citizens because they have no time to
fulfill the responsibilities of friendship and citizenship. He
was right.</b> Because of work, no matter what we do we keep looking
at our watches. The only thing "free" about so-called
free time is that it doesn't cost the boss anything. Free time
is mostly devoted to getting ready for work, going to work, returning
from work, and recovering from work. <b>Free time is a euphemism
for the peculiar way labor as a factor of production not only
transports itself at its own expense to and from the workplace
but assumes primary responsibility for its own maintenance and
repair.</b> Coal and steel don't do that. Lathes and typewriters
don't do that. But workers do. No wonder Edward G. Robinson in
one of his gangster movies exclaimed, "<i>Work is for saps!</i>"
<P>
Both Plato and Xenophon attribute to Socrates and obviously share
with him an awareness of the destructive effects of work on the
worker as a citizen and as a human being. Herodotus identified
contempt for work as an attribute of the classical Greeks at the
zenith of their culture. To take only one Roman example, <b>Cicero
said that "whoever gives his labor for money sells himself
and puts himself in the rank of slaves."</b> His candor is
now rare, but contemporary primitive societies which we are wont
to look down upon have provided spokesmen who have enlightened
Westem anthropologists. The Kapauku of West Irian, according to
Posposil, have a conception of balance in life and accordingly
work only every other day, the day of rest designed "to regain
the lost power and health." Our ancestors, even as late as
the eighteenth century when they were far along the path to our
present predicament, at least were aware of what we have forgotten,
the underside of industrialization. Their religious devotion to
"St. Monday"&#151;thus establishing a <i>de facto</i> five-day
week 150-200 years before its legal consecration&#151;was the despair
of the earliest Factory owners. They took a long time in submitting
to the tyranny of the bell, predecessor of the time clock. In
fact it was necessary for a generation or two to replace adult
males with women accustomed to obedience and children who could
be molded to fit industrial needs. Even the exploited peasants
of the <i>ancien regime</i> wrested substantial time back from
their landlord's work. According to Lafargue; a fourth of the
French peasants' calendar was devoted to Sundays and holidays,
and Chayanov's figures from villages in Czarist Russia&#151;hardly
a progressive society&#151;likewise show a fourth or fifth of peasants'
days devoted to repose. Controlling for productivity, we are obviously
far behind these backward societies. The exploited <i>muzhiks</i>
would wonder why any of us are working at all. So should we.
<P>
<b>To grasp the full enormity of our deterioration, however, consider
the earliest condition of humanity, without government or property,
when we wandered as hunter-gatherers. </b>Hobbes surmised that
life was then nasty, brutish and short. Others assume that life
was a desperate unremitting struggle for subsistence, a war raged
against a harsh Nature with death and disaster awaiting the unlucky
or anyone who was unequal to the challenge of the struggle for
existence. Actually, that was all a projection of fears for the
collapse of govemment authority over communities unaccustomed
to doing without it, like the England of Hobbes during the Civil
War. Hobbes' compatriots had already encountered alternative forms
of society which illustrated other ways of life&#151;in North America,
particularly&#151;but already these were too remote from their experience
to be understandable. (The lower orders, closer to the condition
of the Indians, understood it better and often found it attractive.
<b>Throughout the seventeenth century, English settlers defected
to Indian tribes or, captured in war, refused to return. But the
Indians no more defected to white settlements than West Germans
climb the Berlin Wall from the west.</b>) The "survival of
the fittest" version&#151;the Thomas Huxley version&#151;of Darwinism
was a better account of economic conditions in Victorian England
than it was of natural selection, as the anarchist Kropotkin showed
in his book <i>Mutual Aid, A Factor of Evolution</i>. (Kropotkin
was a scientist&#151;geographer&#151;who'd had ample involuntary opportunity
for fieldwork whilst exiled in Siberia: he knew what he was talking
about. Like most social and political theory, the story Hobbes
and his successors told was really unacknowledged autobiography.
<P>
The anthropologist Marshall Sahlins, surveying the data on contemporary
hunter-gatherers, exploded the Hobbesian myth in an article entitled
"The Original Affluent Society." They work a lot less
than we do, and their work is hard to distinguish from what we
regard as play. Sahlins concluded that "<b>hunters and gatherers
work less than we do; and, rather than a continuous travail, the
food quest is intemmittent, leisure abundant, and there is a greater
amount of sleep in the daytime per capita per year than in any
other condition of society.</b>" They worked an average of
four hours a day, assuming they were "working" at all.
Their "labor," as it appears to us, was skilled labor
which exercised their physical and intellectual capacities; unskilled
labor on any large scale, as Sahlins says, is impossible except
under industrialism. Thus it satisfied Friedrich Schiller's definition
of play, the only occasion on which man realizes his complete
humanity by giving full "play" to both sides of his
twofold nature, thinking and feeling. As he put it: "<b>The
animal <i>works</i> when deprivation is the mainspring of its
activity, and it <i>plays</i> when the fullness of its strength
is this mainspring, when superabundant life is its own stimulus
to activity.</b>" (A modern version&#151;dubiously developmental
- is Abraham Maslow's counterposition of "deficiency"
and "growth" motivation.) Play and freedom are, as regards
production, coextensive. Even Marx, who belongs (for all his good
intentions) in the productivist pantheon, observed that "the
realm of freedom does not commence until the point is passed where
labor under the compulsion of necessity and external utility is
required." He never could quite bring himself to identify
this happy circumstance as what it is, <b>the abolition of work</b>
- it's rather anomalous, after all, to be pro-worker and anti-work
- but we can.
<P>
<b>The aspiration to go backwards or forwards to a life without
work is evident in every serious social or cultural history of
pre-industrial Europe</b>, among them M. Dorothy George's <i>England
in Transition</i> and Peter Burke's <i>Popular Culture in Early
Modern Europe</i>. Also pertinent is Daniel Bell's essay "Work
and Its Discontents," the first text, I believe, to refer
to the "revolt against work" in so many words and, had
it been understood, an important correction to the complacency
ordinarily associated with the volume in which it was collected,
<i>The End of Ideology</i>. Neither critics nor celebrants have
noticed that Bell's end-of-ideology thesis signalled not the end
of social unrest but the beginning of a new, uncharted phase unconstrained
and uninformed by ideology. It was Seymour Lipset (in <i>Political
Man</i>), not Bell, who announced at the same time that "the
fundamental problems of the Industrial Revolution have been solved,"
only a few years before the post- or metaindustrial discontents
of college students drove Lipset from UC Berkeley to the relative
(and temporary) tranquillity of Harvard.
<P>
As Bell notes, Adam Smith in <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>, for
all his enthusiasm for the market and the division of labor, was
more alert to (and more honest about) the seamy side of work than
Ayn Rand or the Chicago economists or any of Smith's modem epigones.
As Smith observed: "<b>The understandings of the greater
part of men are necessarily formed by their ordinary employments.
The man whose life is spent in performing a few simple operations
. . . has no occasion to exert his understanding . . . He generally
becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature
to become.</b>" Here, in a few blunt words, is my critique
of work. Bell, writing in 1956, the Golden Age of Eisenhower imbecility
and American self-satisfaction, identified the unorganized, unorganizable
malaise of the 1970's and since, the one no political tendency
is able to hamess, the one identified in HEW's report <i>Work
in America</i>, the one which cannot be exploited and so is ignored.
<b>That problem is the revolt against work.</b> It does not figure
in any text by any laissez-faire economist&#151;Milton Friedman,
Murray Rothbard, Richard Posner&#151;because, in their terms, as
they used to say on <i>Star Trek</i>, "<A HREF="audio/compute.au">it does not compute</A>."
<P>
If these objections, informed by the love of liberty, fail to
persuade humanists of a utilitarian or even paternalist tum, there
are others which they cannot disregard. <b>Work is hazardous to
your health, to borrow a book title. In fact, work is mass murder
or genocide. Directly or indirectly, work will kill most of the
people who read these words. </b>Between 14,000 and 25,000 workers
are killed annually in this country on the job. Over two million
are disabled. Twenty to twenty-five million are injured every
year. And these figures are based on a very conservative estimation
of what constitutes a work-related injury. Thus they don't count
the half million cases of occupational disease every year. I looked
at one medical textbook on occuptional diseases which was 1,200
pages long. Even this barely scratches the surface. The available
statistics count the obvious cases like the 100,000 miners who
have black lung disease, of whom 4,000 die every year, a much
higher fatality rate than for AIDS, for instance, which gets so
much media attention. This reflects the unvoiced assumption that
AIDS afflicts perverts who could control their depravity whereas
coalmining is a sacrosanct activity beyond question. <b>What the
statistics don't show is that tens of millions of people have
their lifespans shortened by work&#151;which is all that homicide
means, after all.</b> Consider the doctors who work themselves
to death in their 50's. Consider all the other workaholics.
<P>
<b>Even if you aren't killed or crippled while actually working,
you very well might be while going to work, coming from work,
looking for work, or trying to forget about work.</b> The vast
majority of victims of the automobile are either doing one of
these work-obligatory activities or else fall afoul of those who
do them. To this augmented body-count must be added the victims
of auto-industrial pollution and work-induced alcoholism and drug
addiction. Both cancer and heart disease are modern afflictions
normally traceable, directly or indirectly, to work.
<P>
<b>Work, then, institutionalizes homicide as a way of life.</b>
People think the Cambodians were crazy for exterminating themselves,
but are we any different? The Pol Pot regime at least had a vision,
however blurred, of an egalitarian society. <b>We kill people
in the sixfigure range (at least) in order to sell Big Macs and
Cadillacs to the survivors.</b> Our forty or fifty thousand annual
highway fatalities are victims, not martyrs. They died for nothing
- or rather, they died for work. But work is nothing to die for.
<P>
Bad news for liberals: regulatory tinkering is useless in this
life-and-death context. The federal Occupational Safety and Health
Administration was designed to police the core part of the problem,
workplace safety.
<P>
Even before <A HREF="fz/fedzone.htm#raygun">Reagan</A> and the Supreme
Court stifled it, OSHA was a farce. At previous and (by current
standards) generous Carter-era funding levels, a workplace could
expect a random visit from an OSHA inspector once every 46 years.
<P>
State control of the economy is no solution. Work is, if anything,
more dangerous in the state-socialist countries than it is here.
Thousands of Russian workers were killed or injured building the
Moscow subway. <b>Stories reverberate about covered-up Soviet
nuclear disasters which makes Times Beach and Three Mile Island
look like elementary-school air-raid drills.</b> On the other
hand, deregulation, currently fashionable, won't help and will
probably hurt. From a health and safety standpoint, among others,
work was its worst in the days when the economy most closely approximated
laissez-faire. Historians like Eugene Genovese have argued persuasively
that&#151;as antebellum slavery apologists insisted&#151;factory wage-workers
in the Northern American states and in Europe were worse off than
Southern plantation slaves. No rearrangement of relations among
bureaucrats and businessmen seems to make much difference at the
point of production. Serious enforcement of even the rather vague
standards enforceable in theory by OSHA would probably bring the
economy to a standstill. The enforcers apparently appreciate this,
since they don't even try to crack down on most malefactors.
<P>
What I've said so far ought not to be controversial. <b>Many workers
are fed up with work.</b> There are high and rising rates of absenteeism,
turnover, employee theft and sabotage, wildcat strikes, and overall
goldbricking on the job. There may be some movement toward a conscious
and not just visceral rejection of work. And yet the prevalent
feeling, universal among bosses and their agents and also widespread
among workers themselves is that work itself is inevitable and
necessary.
<P>
I disagree. <b>It is now possible to abolish work and replace
it, insofar as it serves useful purposes, with a multitude of
new kinds of activities.</b> To abolish work requires going at
it from two directions, quantitative and qualitative. On the one
hand, on the quantitative side, we have to cut down massively
on the amount of work being done. At present most work is useless
or worse and we should simply get rid of it. On the other hand
- and I think this the crux of the matter and the revolutionary
new departure&#151;we have to take what useful work remains and transform
it into a pleasing variety of game-like and craft-like pastimes,
indistinguishable from other pleasurable pastimes except that
they happen to yield useful end-products. Surely that shouldn't
make them <i>less</i> enticing to do. <b>Then all the artificial
barriers of power and property could come down. Creation could
become recreation. And we could all stop being afraid of each
other.</b>
<P>
I don't suggest that most work is salvageable in this way. But
then most work isn't worth trying to save. <b>Only a small and
diminishing fraction of work serves any useful purpose independent
of the defense and reproduction of the work-system and its political
and legal appendages.</b> Twenty years ago, Paul and Percival
Goodman estimated that just five per cent of the work then being
done&#151;presumably the figure, if accurate, is lower now&#151;would
satisfy our minimal needs for food, clothing and shelter. Theirs
was only an educated guess but the main point is quite clear:
directly or indirectly, <b>most work serves the unproductive purposes
of commerce or social control</b>. Right off the bat we can liberate
tens of millions of salesmen, soldiers, managers, cops, stockbrockers,
clergymen, bankers, lawyers, teachers, landlords, security guards,
ad-men and everyone who works for them. There is a snowball effect
since every time you idle some bigshot you liberate his flunkeys
and underlings also. Thus the economy <i>implodes</i>.
<P>
Forty per cent of the workforce are white-collar workers, most
of whom have some of the most tedious and idiotic jobs ever concocted.
Entire industries, insurance and banking and real estate for instance,
consist of nothing but useless paper-shuffling. It is no accident
that the "tertiary sector," the service sector, is growing
while the "secondary sector" (industry stagnates and
the "primary sector" (agriculture) nearly disappears.
<b>Because work is unnecessary except to those whose power it
secures, workers are shifted from relatively useful to relatively
useless occupations as a measure to assure public order.</b> Anything
is better than nothing. That's why you can't go home just because
you finish early. They want your <i>time</i>, enough of it to
make you theirs, even if they have no use for most of it. Otherwise
why hasn't the average work week gone down by more than a few
minutes in the last fifty years?
<P>
Next we can take a meat-cleaver to production work itself. No
more war production, nuclear power, junk food, feminine hygiene
deodorant&#151;and above all, no more auto industry to speak of.
An occasional Stanley Steamer or Model T might be all right, but
the autoeroticism on which such pestholes as Detroit and Los Angeles
depend is out of the question. Already, without even trying, we've
virtually solved the energy crisis, the environmental crisis and
assorted other insoluble social problems.
<P>
Finally, we must do away with far and away the largest occupation,
the one with the longest hours, the lowest pay and some of the
most tedious tasks around. I refer to <i>housewives</i> doing
housework and childrearing. <b>By abolishing wage-labor and achieving
full unemployment we undermine the sexual division of labor.</b>
The nuclear family as we know it is an inevitable adaptation to
the division of labor imposed by modern wage-work. Like it or
not, as things have been for the last century or two it is economically
rational for the man to bring home the bacon, for the woman to
do the shitwork to provide him with a haven in a heartless world,
<b>and for the children to be marched off to youth concentration
camps&#151;called "schools," primarily to keep them out
of Mom's hair but still under control, but incidentally to acquire
the habits of obedience and punctuality so necessary for workers</b>.
If you would be rid of patriarchy, get rid of the nuclear family
whose unpaid "shadow work," as Ivan Illich says, makes
possible the work-system that makes <i>it</i> necessary. Bound
up with this no-nukes strategy is the abolition of childhood and
the closing of the schools. There are more full-time students
than full-time workers in this country. <b>We need children as
teachers, not students.</b> They have a lot to contribute to the
ludic revolution because they're better at playing than grown-ups
are. Adults and children are not identical but they will become
equal through interdependence. Only play can bridge the generation
gap.
<P>
I haven't as yet even mentioned the possibility of cutting way
down on the little work that remains by automating and cybernizing
it. All the scientists and engineers and technicians freed from
bothering with war research and planned obsolescence should have
a good time devising means to eliminate fatigue and tedium and
danger from activities like mining. Undoubtedly they'll find other
projects to amuse themselves with. Perhaps they'll set up world-wide
all-inclusive multi-media communications systems or found space
colonies. Perhaps. I myself am no gadget freak. I wouldn't care
to live in a pushbutton paradise. I don't want robot slaves to
do everything; I want to do things myself. There is, I think,
a place for laborsaving technology, but a modest place. The historical
and pre-historical record is not encouraging. <b>When productive
technology went from hunting-gathering to agriculture and on to
industry, work increased while skills and self-determination diminished.</b>
The further evolution of industrialism has accentuated what Harry
Braverman called the degradation of work. Intelligent observers
have always been aware of this. John Stuart Mill wrote that all
the labor-saving inventions ever devised haven't saved a moments
labor. Karl Marx wrote that "<b>it would be possible to write
a history of the inventions, made since 1830, for the sole purpose
of supplying capital with weapons against the revolts of the working
class.</b>" The enthusiastic technophiles&#151;Saint-Simon,
Comte, Lenin, B.F. Skinner&#151;have always been unabashed authoritarians
also; which is to say, technocrats. We should be more than skeptical
about the promises of the computer mystics. <i>They</i> work like
dogs; chances are, if they have their way, so will the rest of
us. But if they have any particularized contributions more readily
subordinated to human purposes than the run of high tech, let's
give them a hearing.
<P>
<b>What I really want to see is work turned into play.</b> A first
step is to discard the notions of a "job" and an "occupation."
Even activities that already have some ludic content lose most
of it by being reduced to jobs which certain people, and only
those people, are forced to do to the exclusion of all else. Is
it not odd that farm workers toil painfully in the fields while
their airconditioned masters go home every weekend and putter
about in their gardens? <b>Under a system of permanent revelry,
we will witness the Golden Age of the dilettante which will put
the Renaissance to shame. There won't be any more jobs, just things
to do and people to do them.</b>
<P>
The secret of turning work into play, as Charles Fourier demonstrated,
is to arrange useful activities to take advantage of whatever
it is that various people at various times in fact enjoy doing.
To make it possible for some people to do the things they could
enjoy it will be enough just to eradicate the irrationalities
and distortions which afflict these activities when they are reduced
to work. I, for instance, would enjoy doing some (not too much)
teaching, but I don't want coerced students and I don't care to
suck up to pathetic pedants for tenure.
<P>
Second, there are some things that people like to do from time
to time, but not for too long, and certainly not all the time.
You might enjoy baby-sitting for a few hours in order to share
the company of kids, but not as much as their parents do. The
parents meanwhile profoundly appreciate the time to themselves
that you free up for them, although they'd get fretful if parted
from their progeny for too long. These differences among individuals
are what make a life of free play possible. The same principle
applies to many other areas of activity, especially the primal
ones. Thus many people enjoy cooking when they can practice it
seriously at their leisure, but not when they're just fueling
up human bodies for work.
<P>
Third,&#151;other things being equal,&#151;some things that are unsatisfying
if done by yourself or in unpleasant surroundings or at the orders
of an overlord are enjoyable, at least for awhile, if these circumstances
are changed. This is probably true, to some extent, of all work.
People deploy their otherwise wasted ingenuity to make a game
of the least inviting drudge-jobs as best they can. Activities
that appeal to some people don't always appeal to all others,
but everyone at least potentially has a variety of interests and
an interest in variety. As the saying goes, "anything once."
Fourier was the master at speculating how aberrant and perverse
penchants could be put to use in post-civilized society, what
he called Harmony. <b>He thought the Emperor Nero would have turned
out all right if as a child he could have indulged his taste for
bloodshed by working in a slaughterhouse.</b> Small children who
notoriously relish wallowing in filth could be organized in "Little
Hordes" to clean toilets and empty the garbage, with medals
awarded to the outstanding. I am not arguing for these precise
examples but for the underlying principle, which I think makes
perfect sense as one dimension of an overall revolutionary transformation.
Bear in mind that we don't have to take today's work just as we
find it and match it up with the proper people, some of whom would
have to be perverse indeed. If technology has a role in all this
it is less to automate work out of existence than to open up new
realms for re/creation. To some extent we may want to return to
handicrafts, which William Morris considered a probable and desirable
upshot of communist revolution. Art would be taken back from the
snobs and collectors, abolished as a specialized department catering
to an elite audience, and its qualities of beauty and creation
restored to integral life from which they were stolen by work.
<b>It's a sobering thought that the Grecian urns we write odes
about and showcase in museums were used in their own time to store
olive oil. I doubt our everyday artifacts will fare as well in
the future, if there is one.</b> The point is that there's no
such thing as progress in the world of work; if anything it's
just the opposite. We shouldn't hesitate to pilfer the past for
what it has to offer, the ancients lose nothing yet we are enriched.
<P>
<b>The reinvention of daily life means marching off the edge of
our maps.</b> There is, it is true, more suggestive speculation
than most people suspect. Besides Fourier and Morris&#151;and even
a hint, here and there, in Marx&#151;there are the writings of Kropotkin,
the syndicalists Pataud and Pouget, anarcho-communists old (Berkman)
and new (Bookchin). The Goodman brothers' <i>Communitas</i> is
exemplary for illustrating what forms follow from given functions
(purposes), and there is something to be gleaned from the often
hazy heralds of alternative/appropriate/intermediate/convivial
technology, like Schumacher and especially Illich, once you disconnect
their fog machines. The situationists&#151;as represented by Vaneigem's
<i>Revolution of Everyday Life</i> and in the <i>Situationist
International Anthology</i>&#151;are so ruthlessly lucid as to be
exhilarating, even if they never did quite square the endorsement
of the rule of the workers' councils with the abolition of work.
Better their incongruity, though, than any extant version of leftism,
whose devotees look to be the last champions of work, for if there
were no work there would be no workers, and without workers, who
would the left have to organize?
<P>
So the abolitionists would be largely on their own. <b>No one
can say what would result from unleashing the creative power stultified
by work. Anything can happen.</b> The tiresome debater's problem
of freedom vs. necessity, with its theological overtones, resolves
itself practically once the production of use-values is co-extensive
with the consumption of delightful play activity. Life will become
a game, or rather many games, but not&#151;as it is now&#151;a zero/sum
game. <b>An optimal sexual encounter is the paradigm of productive
play.</b> The participants potentiate each other's pleasures,
nobody keeps score, and everybody wins. <b>The more you give,
the more you get.</b> In the ludic life, the best of sex will
diffuse into the better part of daily life. Generalized play leads
to the libidinization of life. Sex, in turn, can become less urgent
and desperate, more playful.
