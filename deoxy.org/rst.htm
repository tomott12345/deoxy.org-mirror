<strong>T</strong>hose who assume (often unconsciously) that it is impossible to
achieve their life's desires-and, thus, that it is futile to fight for
<em>themselves</em>--usually end up fighting for an ideal or cause instead. They may <em>appear</em> to engage in self-directed activity, but in reality they have accepted alienation from their desires as a way of life. All subjugations of personal desires to the dictates of a cause or ideology are reactionary no matter how "revolutionary" the actions arising from such subjugations may appear.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Yet, one of the great secrets of our miserable, yet potentially
marvelous time, is that thinking can be a pleasure. Despite the
suffocating effect of the dominant religious and political ideologies,
many individuals <em>do</em> learn to think for themselves; and by doing so--by
actively, critically thinking for themselves, rather than by passively
accepting pre-digested opinions--they reclaim their minds as their own.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 This is a manual for those who wish to think for themselves, a manual
for creation of a personally (rather than ideologically) constructed body
of critical thought for your own use, a body of thought which will help
you to understand why your life is the way it is and why the world is the
way it is. More importantly, as you construct your own theory, you will
also develop a <em>practice:</em> a method to get what you want for your own life.
Theory, then, must be either practical--a guide to action--or it will be
nothing, nothing but an aquarium of ideas, a contemplative interpretation of the world. The realm of ideas divorced from actions is the eternal waiting room of unrealized desires. Forming your own practical theory, what could be called "self-theory," is intimately connected to achieving the realization of your desires.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Therefore, constructing your self-theory is a revolutionary pleasure. It
is both a destructive and constructive pleasure, because you are creating
a practical theory--one tied to action--for the destruction and
reconstruction of this society. It is a theory of adventure, because it is
based on what you want from life and on devising the means necessary to
achieve it. It is as erotic and humorous as an authentic revolution.

<p>
<strong>A</strong>ny system of ideas with an abstraction at its center--an abstraction
which assigns you a role or duties--is an ideology. An ideology provides
those who accept it with a false consciousness, a necessary component of
which is other-directedness. This leads those who accept the ideology to
behave as "objects" rather than "subjects," to allow themselves to be
used rather than to act to attain their <em>own</em> desires. The various ideologies
are all structured around different abstractions, yet all serve the interests
of a dominant (or aspiring dominant) class by giving individuals (though
the term hardly seems appropriate--"members of the herd" is perhaps
more accurate) a sense of purpose in sacrifice, suffering, and submission.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Religious ideology is the oldest example: the fantastic projection called
"God" is the Supreme Subject of the cosmos, acting on every human
being as "His" object.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  In the "scientific" and "democratic" ideologies of "free enterprise,"
capital investment is the "productive" subject directing world history--the 
"invisible hand" guiding human development. In order to
prosper, the early capitalists had to attack and weaken the power that
religious ideology once held. They exposed the mystification of the
religious world and replaced it with the mystification of technology and
commodity capitalism, wherein Profit becomes the Supreme Subject of
the cosmos.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  The 57 varieties of leninism are "revolutionary" ideologies in which
the Party is the rightful subject entitled to dictate world history by
leading its object--you, the proletariat--to the promised land through
replacement of the corporate-capitalist "free enterprise" apparatus with
a state-capitalist leninist apparatus.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  The many other varieties of dominant ideologies can be seen daily.
The new forms of religious mysticism help to preserve the status quo in a
round about way. They provide a cheap and tidy way to obscure the
vacuousness of daily life and, like drugs, make it easier to live, or rather
exist, with this emptiness--and so prevent us from recognizing our real
roles in the functioning of the socio-economic system.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  All of these ideologies differ in the specific sacrifices they demand of
you, the object, but all are <em>structured</em> in the same way. All demand an
inversion of subject and object; things, abstractions, take on the human
attributes of power and will, while human beings become things, tools to
be used in the service of these abstractions (God, the dictatorship of the
proletariat, the fatherland, etc., etc.). Ideology is upside down
self-theory. It fosters acceptance of the separation of our narrow, daily
lives from a world that appears totally beyond our control. Ideology
offers us only a voyeur's relationship with the life of the world.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  All abstraction-based ideologies demand duty, sacrifice for the cause;
and every such ideology serves to protect the dominant social order.
Authorities whose power depends upon docility must deny us our
subjectivity, our conscious will to act for our <em>own</em> desires. Such denial
comes in the form of demands for sacrifices for "the common good,"
"the national interest," "the war effort," "the revolution,".....
<p><br><p><br>
<table align="left" border="0" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="12"><tr><td><font size="+4">3</font></td></tr></table>

<p>
  <strong>W</strong>e rid ourselves of the blinders of ideology by constantly asking
ourselves: How do I feel? How's my life? What do I want? Am I getting
what I want? If not, why not? This is being conscious of the
commonplace, being aware of your everyday routine. That real life
exists--life in which you are active, a subject acting to achieve your
desires--is a public secret that becomes less secret every day, as the
breakdown of daily life constructed around abstraction-based ideologies
becomes more and more obvious.

<p>
 <strong>T</strong>he creation of self-theory is based on thinking for yourself, on being
fully conscious of your desires and of their validity. Authentic
"consciousness raising" can only be the "raising" of people's thinking
to the level of positive (non-guilty) self-consciousness, free of imposed
morality in all its forms. This type of consciousness can be termed
"radical subjectivity."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Conversely, what many leftists, therapy mongers, racism awareness
trainers, and sisterizers term "consciousness raising" is the practice of
beating people into unconsciousness with guilt-inducing, ideological
billyclubs.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The path from self-negation to self-affirmation passes through point
zero, the capital city of nihilism. This is the windswept still point in social
space and time, the social limbo in which one recognizes that there is no
real life in one's daily existence. A nihilist knows the difference between
surviving and living.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Nihilists reverse their perspectives on their lives and the world.
Nothing is true for them but their desires, their will to be. They reject all
ideology in their hatred for the miserable social relations in modern
society. From this reversed perspective they clearly see the upside-down
world of commodity capitalism in which subject and object are inverted,
and people and abstract concepts are converted into things, commodities
to be sold. They see daily life as a theatrical landscape in which
"everyone has their price," God (via televangelism) and happiness (smile
buttons) become commodities, radio stations say they love you, and
detergents have compassion for your hands.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Daily conversation offers sedatives such as, "You can't always get
what you want," "Life has its ups and downs," and other cliches of the
secular religion of survival. "Common sense" is just the non-sense of
common alienation. Every day people are denied (and deny themselves)
an authentic life and are sold back its representation.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Nihilists constantly feel the urge to destroy the system which destroys
them. They cannot go on living as they are. Soon, most realize that they
must devise a coherent set of tactics in order to transform the world.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  But if a nihilist does not recognize the possibility for the transformation 
 of the world, his or her subjective rage will ossify into a role: the
suicide, the solitary murderer, the street hoodlum-vandal, the neo-dadaist, 
the professional mental patient... all seeking compensation for a life of dead time.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  The nihilists' mistake is that they do not realize that there are other
nihilists with whom they can work. Consequently, they assume that participation in a collective project of self-realization is impossible.

  <strong>T</strong>his project of collective self-realization, the changing of life itself
through the transformation of social relations, can properly be termed
"politics." Politics, however, also signifies a mystified, separate
category of human activity, an isolated interest with its own specialists--politicians, political consultants, etc. It is possible to be interested (or
not) in this type of politics just as it is possible to be interested (or not) in
football, stamp collecting, music, or fashion. What people see as
"politics" today is the social falsification of the project of collective
self-realization; it has become a spectacle and a parody. And that suits
those in power just fine.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 <em>Authentic</em> collective self-realization is <em>the</em> revolutionary project. It is
the collective transformation of social relations and the natural world
according to the desires of all participants.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Similarly, "therapy" at present usually refers to attempts to "help"
individuals "adjust" to their restrictive social roles and to the banality of
daily life. <em>Authentic</em> therapy involves changing one's own life by
changing the nature of social life. Therapy must be social if it is to be of
any real consequence. Social therapy (the healing of society) and
individual therapy (the healing of the individual) are linked together:
each requires the other, each is a necessary part of the other.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 For example, in present day society we are expected to repress our real
feelings and play a <em>role.</em> This is called "playing a part in society" (how
revealing that phrase is). Individuals put on "character armor" --a
steel-like suit comprised of role playing, posing, and concealing one's
desires as a defense against other individuals. Transforming social
relations and surpassing the role-playing game requires the conscious
decision of most if not all individuals to shed these roles and truly
communicate; therefore, the end of individual role playing is directly
related to the end of social role playing.

 <strong>T</strong>o think actively, critically, is to make your life--as it is now, and as
you want it to be--the center of your thinking. This positive 
self-centering is accomplished by a continuous assault on externals, on
the false issues ("support our troops"), false conflicts (e.g., those arising
from notions of racial "superiority"), false identities ("American,"
"patriot," "Catholic," "white Christian"), and false dichotomies
("economic survival" versus "a clean environment") which permeate
social life.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 People are kept from analyzing the basic nature, the totality, of
everyday life by the media focus--including "consumer" surveys and
public opinion polls--on mere details: the spectacular trifles, the phony
controversies, and ridiculous scandals. Are you for or against trade
unions, cruise missiles, identity cards? What's your opinion of soft
drugs, jogging, UFOs, progressive taxation, Michael Jackson's latest
nose job, the royal family's sexual relations?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  These are diversions, false issues. The only issue for us is how we live.
There's an old Jewish saying, "If you have only two alternatives, then
choose the third." It impels people to search for new perspectives. We
can see the artificiality of false dichotomies by searching for that "third
choice."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Being conscious that there is a third choice allows us to refuse to
choose between two supposedly opposite, but equally repulsive,
possibilities which are presented to us as the <em>only</em> possible choices. In its
simplest form, this "third choice" consciousness is expressed by the
person brought to trial for armed robbery and asked, "Do you plead
guilty or not guilty?" "I'm hungry and unemployed," she replies. A more 
theoretical, but equally classic, illustration of this consciousness is
the refusal to choose between the corporate-capitalist ruling classes of
the West and the state-capitalist ruling classes of what's left of the
Eastern bloc. All we need to do is to look at the basic social relations of
production in the USA and Europe on the one hand, and China, North
Korea, and Cuba on the other, to see that they are essentially the same:
over there, as here, the vast majority work for a wage or salary in
exchange for giving up control over their life's work, control over both
what they produce and how they produce it. And, of course, what they
produce in both East and West is then sold back to them as commodities.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  In the West, the surplus value, or the value produced over and above
the value of the workers' wages, is the property of the corporate
management and stockholders, who keep up a show of domestic
competition. In the East, the surplus value is the property of the state
bureaucracy, which does not permit domestic competition. Big difference.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Like the false issues and false conflicts cited above, false questions are
used to distract us from living in the present, from seeing the totality of
existence. One example is the stupid conversational question, "What's
your philosophy of life?" It poses an abstract concept of "life" that has
nothing to do with real life because it ignores the fact that "living" is
exactly what we are doing at the present moment, and our "philosophy
of life" is clearly revealed by our actions.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  False identities are perhaps an even more potent form of mystification. 
In the absence of real community, people cling to all kinds of
phony social identities--they contemplate and attempt to emulate a huge
variety of roles presented to them in school, church, and, especially, the
"entertainment" media. These social identities can be ethnic ("Italian-
American"), residential ("New Yorker"), nationalistic ("patriot"),
sexual ("gay"), cultural ("Giants fan"), and so on; but all are rooted in
a common desire for affiliation, for belonging.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Obviously being "black" is a much more real identification than being
a "Giants fan," but beyond a certain point, such an identification only
serves to mask one's real position in society; and in order to recognize
that real position, you have to reject the false identities, false conflicts,
and false dichotomies, and begin with yourself as the center. From there
you can examine the material basis of your life, stripped of mystification.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  An example: Suppose that you want a cup of coffee from the vending
machine at work. First, there is the cup of coffee itself: that involves the
workers on the coffee plantation, the ones on the sugar plantation and in
the refineries, the ones in the paper mill, and so on. Then you have the
workers who made the different parts of the vending machine and the
ones who assembled it. Then the ones who extracted the iron ore and
bauxite, smelted the steel, and work for the electric utility which supplies
power to the machine. Then all the workers who transported the coffee,
cups, and machine. Then the clerks, typists, and communication workers
who coordinated the production and transportation. Finally, you have
all the workers who produced all the other things necessary for the other
ones to survive. That gives you a direct material relationship to several
million people, in fact, to the immense majority of the world's
population. They produce your life, and you help to produce theirs. In
this light, all artificial group identities and special group interests fade
into insignificance. Imagine the potential enrichment of your life that at
present is locked up in the frustrated creativity of these millions of
workers, held back by obsolete and exhausting methods of production,
strangled by lack of control over their own productivity, warped by the
insane rationale of capital-accumulation which pits one against all and
makes life a mad scramble for economic survival. Here we begin to
discover a real social identity--in people all over the world who are
fighting to win control over their own lives we find ourselves.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Those who have a vested interested in the political and economic status
quo continually present us with false choices, that is, with choices which
preserve their power ("Vote Democratic!"/"Vote Republican! "--"But
Vote!"). We are constantly being asked to choose sides in false conflicts.
Governments, corporations, political parties, and propagandists of all
kinds constantly present us with "choices" that are no choice at all. We
are given the illusion of choice, but as long as those in power control
what our "choices" will be ("choices" which we perceive as the only
alternatives available to us), they will also control the outcome of our
"decisions."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The new moralists love to tell those of us in the rich West how we will
"have to make sacrifices," how we "exploit the starving children of the
Third World." The choice we are given is between sacrificial altruism or
narrow individualism. (Charities cash in on the resulting guilt.) Yes, by
living in the rich, wasteful West we do exploit the poor of the Third
World--but not personally, not deliberately. We can make some changes
in our lives, boycott, make sacrifices, but the effects are marginal. We
become aware of the false conflict with which we've been presented when
we realize that under the global socio-economic system we, as
individuals, are locked into our roles as "exploiters" just as others are
locked into their global roles as the exploited. We have a role, but little
power to change it--at least individually. Therefore, we reject the false
choice of "sacrifice or selfishness" by calling for the destruction of the
global social system whose existence forces that decision upon us.
Tinkering with the system, or offering token sacrifices, or calling for "a
little less selfishness," simply won't do. Charities and reformers never go
beyond such false choices as "sacrifice" or "selfishness"--but if any
true social progress is to be made, the rest of us must do so.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Those in power continually use such falsifications to divert and
disempower us. By spreading myths like, "If we shared it all there
wouldn't be enough to go around," they attempt to deny the existence of
any real choices and to hide from us the fact that <em>the material
preconditions for social revolution already exist.</em>

  <strong>A</strong>ny journey toward self-demystification must avoid the twin
quagmires of absolutism and cynicism.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Absolutism is the total acceptance or rejection of all components of
particular ideologies, or indeed, of any set of ideas or concepts. An
absolutist cannot see any choice other than complete acceptance or
complete rejection; s/he sees things purely as good or bad, black or
white. The absolutist wanders along the shelves of the ideological
supermarket looking for the ideal commodity, and then buys it lock,
stock and barrel. But the ideological supermarket--like any supermarket--is 
fit only for looting. It is of more practical use to us to move along
the shelves, rip open the packets, take out what looks authentic and
useful, and dump the rest.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Cynicism is a reaction to a world dominated by ideology and
"morality." Faced with conflicting ideologies, the cynic says, "A plague
on both your houses." The cynic is as much a consumer as the absolutist,
but one who has given up hope of finding the ideal commodity.

 <strong>T</strong>he process of constructive thinking is a process of continually
adding to and modifying one's current body of self-theory as well as
resolving contradictions between one's new thoughts and perceptions
and one's previous beliefs. The resulting synthesis is thus more than the
sum of its parts.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 This synthetic method of constructing a theory is counter to the
eclectic method in which one collects a rag bag of favorite bits from
favorite ideologies without ever confronting the resulting contradictions.
Modern examples include "anarcho-capitalism," "christian marxism,"
and liberalism in general.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 If we are continually conscious of how we want to live, we can
critically appropriate from <em>anything:</em> ideologies, culture critics, technoratic 
experts, sociological studies, even mystics (though the pickings will probably be slim). 
All the rubbish of the old world can be scavenged for useful material by those who want to reconstruct it.
<p><br><p><br>
<table align="left" border="0" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="12"><tr><td><font size="+4">9</font></td></tr></table>

<p>
 <strong>T</strong>he nature of modern society, unified globally through its capitalist
economic system, makes necessary a self-theory which criticizes all areas
in which socio-economic domination exists (i.e., both the corporate
capitalism of the "free" world and the state capitalism of the
"communist" world) as well as all forms of alienation (sexual poverty,
enforced participation in the rat race for survival, etc.). In other words,
we need a critique of the totality of daily existence from the perspective
of the totality of our desires.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Opposed to this project are all the politicians and bureaucrats,
preachers and gurus, city planners and policemen, reformers and
leninists, central committees and censors, corporate managers and union
honchos, male supremacists and feminist ideologues, landlords and
eco-capitalists who work to subordinate individual desires to that
hideous abstraction, "the common good," of which they are the
supposed guardians. They are all forces of the old world-bosses,
priests, and other creeps who have something to lose if people extend the
game of seizing back their minds into seizing back their lives.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Revolutionary theory and abstraction-based ideologies are enemies,
and every politically conscious person knows it.
<p><br><p><br>

<p>
 <strong>B</strong>y now it should be obvious that self-demystification and the creation
of our own revolutionary theory do not eradicate our alienation; "the
world," with its capitalist economic relations permeating every aspect of
life, goes on and is reproduced every day with the acquiescence and
assistance of billions of people.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Although this text has the creation of self-theory as its focus, we do
not mean to imply that revolutionary theory can exist separately from
revolutionary practice. In order to be consequential, to effectively
reconstruct the world, practice must be based in theory, and theory must
be realized in practice. The revolutionary project of ending alienation
and transforming social relations requires that one's theory be nothing
other than a theory of practice, realized in what we do and how we live.
Otherwise theory will degenerate into an impotent contemplation of the
world, and ultimately into a survival mechanism--an intellectual armor
that acts as a buffer between the daily world and oneself. And if
revolutionary practice is not the practice of revolutionary theory, it
degenerates into, at best, altruistic militantism--"revolutionary" activity 
as one's social duty or role. At worst, it degenerates into pure gangsterism.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 We don't strive for a coherent theory purely as an end in itself. For us,
the value of coherency is that it makes it easier to think critically and
effectively. For example, it's easier to understand future developments in
social control if you have a coherent understanding of present-day social
control ideologies and techniques.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Having a coherent theory makes it easier to put into practice your
strategy for realizing your desires.

 <strong>I</strong>n the process of constructing self-theory, the last theories that must
be dealt with (one hesitates to call them "ideologies," as they are not
based in abstractions with their accompanying "shoulds" and "duties")
are the ones that have the most resemblance to revolutionary self-theory.
These are situationism and syndicalism.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The Situationist International (1958-1971) was an organization of
theoretically oriented, ultra-left, European (especially French) marxists.
Many believe, as did the original author(s) of this essay, that the
situationists "made an immense contribution to revolutionary theory."
That evaluation is, however, overly generous. Virtually all of the key
insights attributed to situationist writers can be found in the works of
earlier anarchists, social democrats, and philosphers such as Alexander
Berkman, Emma Goldman, Oscar Wilde, George Bernard Shaw,
Wilhelm Reich and Friedrich Nietzsche (though the insights in question
were scattered and often were not developed with the rigor found in the
better situationist texts). The primary reason that this is not widely
recognized is that most of the early situationists and their followers came
from marxist backgrounds and were simply not familiar with the vast
body of non-marxist progressive writings produced in prior decades; and
the younger situationist followers often have had very little in the way of
political experience and are as unfamiliar with early progressive literature
as were their marxist predecessors.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  A secondary reason for the overestimation of the importance of the
situationists is that situationism is a French ideology utilizing an arcane
marxist-derived jargon ('poverty of...,' 'society of the spectacle,'
'reification,' 'dialectical,' etc., etc.); as well, virtually all situationist
texts are written in a very difficult to follow, jargon-ridden, muddy
style--which makes them inaccessible to most people. Thus, situationism
has a great deal of snob appeal for those with intellectual pretensions.
Once you've mastered the jargon and read (or claim to have read) the key
(one is tempted to say "sacred") texts, you certainly at least appear to be
an intellectual. Thus it's not surprising that "situationist" poseurs,
1atched as they are to their "situationist" roles and "intellectual"
pretensions, often have little regard for truth and regard decent human
behavior as "bourgeois"; it follows, then, that in political controversies
they often resort to deliberate distortions, fabrications, and ad hominem
attacks upon those who have the temerity to criticize their ideas. (Some,
incredibly, have even used the slogan, 'the personal is political,' as an
excuse for scurrilous personal attacks.) The destructive-and ultimately
self~defeating~effects of these vicious tactics are so obvious as to need
no further comment.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  But perhaps the most critical~weakness of situationism is that it offers
no coherent method for "getting from here to there," that is, from "the
society of the spectacle" to the free society.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Having said this, it should be added that the great virtue of the 
situationist writers was that they presented their insights in a more or less
coherent manner and expounded upon them at length. (The qualifer "more or less" 
is used due to the very low quality, stylistically, of almost all situationist 
texts.) At its best, situationist theory offered a critique of "spectacular" 
society, that is, society in which people are reduced to the level of passive 
observers and consumers rather than active participants. It made an extensive 
critique of how both ideology and commodification turn people into passive, 
alienated observers of their own lives. Thus, situationist theory is a body of 
critical thought which can be incorporated into one's own self-theory--but 
nothing more. Anything more--the unquestioning acceptance of situationist 
theories and the identification of oneself with those theories--is the 
ideological misappropriation known as situationism. Situationism can be quite 
the complete survival ideology, a defense against the wear and tear of daily 
life. And included in the ideology is the spectacular role of being a 
"situationist," that is, a radical jade and ardent esoteric.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  The other body of ideas which bears a great deal of resemblance to
revolutionary self-theory is, to use the term broadly, syndicalism.
Variants include anarcho-syndicalism, revolutionary syndicalism, and
council communism, with anarcho-syndicalism being the most important
of the three.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Real self-management is the direct management (without any separate
leadership) of social production, distribution, and communication by
workers and their communities. The movement for self-management has
appeared again and again all over the world in the course of social
revolution: Russia in 1905 and 1917-1921; Spain in 1936-1939; Hungary
in 1956; Algeria in 1960; Chile in 1972; and Portugal in 1975. The form
of organization most often created in the practice of self-management
has been workers' councils: sovereign assemblies of producers and
neighbors that elect delegates to coordinate their activities. The delegates
are not representatives, but carry out decisions already made by their
assemblies. Delegates can be recalled at any time should the general
assembly feel that its decisions are not being rigorously carried out.
Partisans of all of the above-mentioned forms of syndicalism advocate
such practices.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  The great virtues of syndicalism are, first, that it seeks to destroy all
coercive authority as well as the commodity (i.e., capitalist) economy.
Second, it does provide a practical means of "getting from here to
there." And third, it recognizes that the one essential function of social
organization is to provide the economic base-production and distribution of 
goods and services-upon which all else rests. Syndicalism
recognizes that this is the one area in which extensive organization (of the
libertarian type described above) is needed, and that it's best to leave all
other areas of life as free as possible from organizational influence.
Virtually all critics of syndicalism, including the original author(s) of this
pamphiet, miss this essential point. (It's certainly true that a thorough
critique of all types of domination and mystification is necessary to
social transformation, but one need only glance at the better syndicalist
publications to see that at least some syndicalists are making such a
critique.) Given the destruction of coercive authority (one of syndicalism's 
central goals) and adequate advance preparation (i.e., demystification), it 
would be absurd not to expect an explosion of creativity in all areas of life--
art, music, writing, architecture, family relations, sexual relations, community 
structure, etc., etc.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  There are, however, two great dangers in syndicalism. The first is that
many syndicalists develop tunnel vision: they become so obsessed with
labor struggles and self-managed economic schemes that they not only fail to 
analyze non-workplace-related forms of domination and mystification, but they 
often act as if such problems do not even exist. Thus, if this syndicalist 
tendency would succeed in its aims, it could well help to produce a self-managed 
society in which other-than-economic forms of domination and mystification still 
exert their baleful influences--for example, it's easy to envisage a worker-controlled 
economic system which coexists with religious mystification, homophobia, and sexism.
This would be contrary to anarchist principles, but many syndicalists are syndicalists 
first and anarchists (or "antiauthoritarians") second, which is more than a bit like 
the tail wagging the dog.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  The second danger is related to the first: syndicalists sometimes forget
that syndicalist organizations are just a means to an end. They
sometimes develop a bad case of organizational fetishism; this can be
termed "organizationitis"--an intellectual hallucination in which means
and ends are reversed, in which the syndicalist organization is perceived
as an end in itself, as being more important than its goal (the free
society). Sadly, in some cases that goal seems to be entirely forgotten.
And, even more sadly, "organizationitis" sometimes--but not inevitably--
leads to an even worse disease, bureaucratization.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But these are not condemnations of syndicalist theory; they simply
show that even the best theory is, in itself, no guarantee that its holders
will always act in accord with its principles or will develop insights which
go beyond those contained in the theory. This isn't terribly surprising.
We all live in the world of commodity capitalism, and it would be
shocking if we weren't burdened to a greater or lesser degree with the
character traits such a life engenders; and it would be equally shocking if
these character traits didn't cause problems in syndicalist organizations
--indeed, in organizations of any type, including the most informal.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Still, the situation is far from hopeless. A high degree of personal
awareness among participants can reduce the dangers of organizationitis
and bureaucratization. As well, there are many procedural devices which
are very effective at reducing such problems; these include decentralization, 
mandatory rotation of offices, term limitations, strict delimitation
of responsibilities, and immediate recallability. With such safeguards,
participation in common projects of self-liberation is more than feasible;
it's desirable.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="+2">
 The world can only be turned right side up by the conscious collective
activity of those who construct a theory of why it is upside down.
Spontaneous rebellion alone is not sufficient. Without adequate advance
preparation, the old world will simply reappear after any rebellion,
embedded as it is in the psyches of the fabled "people." An authentic
revolution can only occur if there is a coherent and practical mass
movement of self-conscious individuals in which all of the mystifications
of the past are being consciously swept away.</font>

<p><br><h2>Notes</h2>

     <strong>T</strong>his essay was originally published in the United States in
1975 by <em>The Spectacle</em> under the title <i>"Self-Theory: the pleasure of
thinking for yourself."</i> An extensively revised edition was published in
London in 1985 by <em>Spectacular Times</em> under the title <i>"Revolutionary
self-help: a beginner's manual,"</i> and it has appeared twice since then in
American periodicals under the title <i>"Revolutionary Self-Theory";</i> in
1989 it was published in a slightly revised edition by OVO, and in 1992 in
a further revised edition by <em>No Longer Silent</em> (NLS). This edition is an
extensively rewritten and somewhat expanded version of the text which
appeared in NLS.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 As the editor of <em>No Longer Silent</em> commented, "...at this point it's
fair to say that 'RST' has been penned by multiple authors, which is as it
should be. Hopefully this trend will continue as future editions of this
text appear. After all, the propaganda, literature, and so forth that we
produce should not be considered as immutable tomes, determining the
language and boundaries within which we are expected to interpret our
experiences, but rather as fluid and alterable, reflecting our experience of
reality <em>as we are."</em>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 This is entirely in keeping with the sentiments of the previous
authors/editors who stated, "...the ideological supermarket--like any
supermarket--is fit only for looting. It is more productive for us if we
move along the shelves, rip open the packets, take out what looks
authentic and useful, and dump the rest."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 In fact, that is exactly the approach which I've taken while editing this
text: I've retained those portions which were useful and insightful, but
I've also jettisoned a lot of waste material, including almost all of the
marxist/situationist jargon plus a number of statements (particularly in
the concluding section) which were factually incorrect or simply missed
the point; as well, I've cleaned up the text by eliminating a number of
non sequiturs and hopelessly fuzzy statements and by using terms (e.g.,
"ideology") in a more precise manner than in the previous editions of
this work. What I've done, essentially, is to take a situationist tract and
translate it into plain English.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I've also introduced a certain amount of new material which
contradicts some of what I've deleted. Thus, it's quite possible-in fact
quite probable-that the authors/editors of the previous versions of this
essay would take strong exception to some of the changes I've made.
While I regret that my alterations and additions may upset the original
author(s), the point of this pamphlet is to get people to think for
themselves; and I believe that the changes I've made increase the
effectiveness of the pamphlet in that regard.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 But despite the changes in this edition, the central thesis of this essay
remains unchanged: that all genuine revolutionary impulses and
activities stem directly from the desires of individuals, <em>not</em> from any 
ideologically imposed sense of "duty" with its attendant guilt,
self-sacrifice, and self-deadening "shoulds."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 As the previous authors/editors of this pamphlet have chosen to
