<h1>Celtic Folklore:<br> The People of the Mounds<br>Articles on the Sidhe</h1>
<em>L. MacDonald DALRIADA MAGAZINE 1993</em>
<blockquote>
                   "For all the hillside was haunted
                    By the faery folk come again
                    And down in the heart-light enchanted
                    Were opal-coloured men"
                                                 AE
</blockquote>
  In the first article of this series, I looked at the survival of belief
  among the Celtic peoples of an invisible realm inhabited by
  Otherworldly beings known collectively as the Sidhe, or the Good People.
  This belief was once common throughout all the Celtic countries, in
  localised forms. The Sidhe are considered to be a distinct race, quite
  separate from human beings yet who have had much contact with mortals
  over the centuries, and there are many documented testimonies to this.
  Belief in this race of beings who have powers beyond those of men to
  move quickly through the air and change their shape at will once played
  a huge part in the lives of people living in rural Ireland and Scotland.
<p>
  It is difficult to pin-point an exact historical era as the time when
  fairy lore began. Many writers maintain that the people of Ireland and
  their Gods before the coming of the Gaels are the 'ancestors' of the
  sidhe. Clearly the belief in the sidhe is part of the pre-Christian
  religion which survived for thousands of years and which has never been
  completely wiped out from the minds of the people. When the first Gaels,
  the sons of Mil, arrived in Ireland, they found that the Tuatha De
  Danaan, the people of the goddess Dana, already had control of the land.
  The sons of Mil fought them in battle and defeated them, driving them
  'underground' where it is said they remain to this day in the hollow
  hills or sidhe mounds.
<p>
  In the early Irish manuscripts (which were recorded from an earlier oral
  tradition) we find references to the Tuatha De Danaan. In 'The Book of
  the Dun Cow' and the 'Book of Leinster' this race of beings is described
  as "gods and not gods", pointing to the fact that they are 'something in
  between'. Also in the Book of the Dun Cow it says of wise men that:
  "it seems likely to them that they [the Tuatha De Danaan] came from
  heaven, on account of their intelligence and excellence of their
  knowledge".
<p>
  The hold that the Tuatha De Danaan had on the Irish mind was so strong
  that the new religion of Christianity could not shake it. In 'The
  Colloquy of the Ancients' a dialogue which supposedly took place
  between St. Patrick and the ghost of Caeilte of the Fianna, Patrick is
  amazed to see a fairy woman coming out of the cave of Cruachan, wearing
  a green mantle with a crown of gold on her head. Whereas the fairy woman
  is young and beautiful, Caeilte himself is old and withered. When
  Patrick enquires of this, Caeilte tells him that:
<p>
  "She is of the Tuatha De Danaans who are unfading...and I am of the sons
  of Mil, who are perishable and fade away".
<p>
  The sidhe of the subterranean mounds are also seen by the Irish as the
  descendants of the old agricultural gods of the Earth, (one of the most
  important being Crom Cruaich, the Crooked One of the Hill). These gods
  controlled the ripening of the crops and the milk yields of the cattle,
  therefore offerings had to be given to them regularly. In the Book of
  Leinster we discover that after their conquest the Tuatha De Danaan took
  revenge on the sons of Mil by destroying their wheat and the goodness of
  the milk (the sidhe are notorious for this even today). The sons of Mil
  were thus forced to make a treaty with them, and ever since that time
  the people of Ireland have honoured this treaty by leaving offerings of
  milk and butter to the Good People.
<p>
  A notable feature of the sidhe is that they have distinct tribes, ruled
  over by fairy kings and queens in each territory. It would seem that the
  social order of the sidhe corresponds to the old aristocracy of ancient
  Irish families, which is in itself a reflection of the ancient Celtic
  caste system. It is interesting to note that many of the Irish refer to
  the sidhe as simply "the gentry", on account of their tall, noble
  appearance and silvery sweet speech. They have their own palaces where
  they feast and play music, but also have regular battles with
  neighbouring tribes. The great fairy hosts seem to be distinctly
  Milesian, but there are still folk memories of perhaps older pre-Gaelic
  races and their gods, in the form of the 'geancanach', a spirit
  of Ulster, or the 'cluricaun', of Munster. We must not forget also the
  'leprechaun', a diminutive creature who is said to know the whereabouts
  of a pot of gold hidden in local fairy raths. The leprechaun could
  possibly be a folk memory of a dwarfish race of Fir Bolg people who
  lived in these raths before the coming of the Gaels.
<p>
  In the testimonies of many rural folk a distinction is often made
  between the sidhe who are seen walking on the ground after sunset, and
  the 'Sluagh Sidhe', the fairy host who travel through the air at night,
  and are known to 'take' mortals with them on their journeys. There are
  also guardian sidhe of most of the lakes of Ireland and Scotland. These
  distinct categories of sidhe beings ties in with the testimonies of
  seers who divide the sidhe into wood spirits, water spirits, air spirits
  and so on, the elemental spirits of each place.
<p>
  Lough Gur in County Limerick is a very magical place where we meet many
  of the sidhe kings and queens of Ireland. The lake lies within a circle
  of low lying hills, but once every seven years it appears as dry land,
  where an entrance to the Land of Youth may be found. The lake's guardian
  is known as Toice Bhrean (the lazy one) because she neglected to watch
  over the well, from which the lake sprang forth. It is  believed that
  once every seven years a mortal meets their death by drowning in the
  lake, 'taken' by the Beann Fhionn, the White Lady.

<h2>FAIRY QUEENS OF IRELAND</h2>

  There are many great fairy queens that are remembered in Irish folk
  tales. They are known as 'bean righean na brugh', the fairy queen of
  the palace, and are quite clearly the tutelary goddesses of local
  tribes. Many are still said to be the guardians of certain Irish clans.
<p>
  Three miles south west of Lough Gur is Cnoc Aine, or Knockainy, the hill
  of Aine, one of the most important fairy queens of Munster. Also on the
  shores of the lake is Cnoc Finnine, of the goddess Fennel, the sister of
  Aine.
<p>
  Many of the sidhe folk have encounters or relationships with mortals.
  The Earl of Desmond once saw Aine combing her hair on the bank of a
  river. He fell in love with her and seizing her cloak made her his wife.
  The offspring of this union was Aine's enchanted son Geroid Iarla, who
  lives under the lake awaiting his return to the world of men. Once every
  seven years he emerges from the water as a phantom riding on a white
  horse.
<p>
  Aine is revered throughout Ireland. In Co. Derry locals say she was a
  mortal woman who was 'taken' by the fairies; the local family O'Corra
  are said to be descended from Aine. In Co. Louth Aine's stronghold is
  at Dunany point (Dun Aine). Every year three days are dedicated to her,
  the first Friday, Saturday and Sunday after Lammas; it was said that she
  would claim a life on those days.
<p>
  It is at Cnoc Aine in Co. Limerick where Aine is most well remembered as
  a great queen. Every year on St. John's Eve (24 June) local people would
  form a procession around the hill, then carry flaming torches through
  the fields of ripening crops. Aine herself was seen on many occasions
  leading the procession.
<p>
  The fairy queen of the north of Munster is Aoibheal; she is the
  ancestral deity of the O'Briens, (the descendants of Brian Boru) who
  rules from  Craig Liath (grey rock) in Co. Clare. At the great battle
  of Clontarf, Aoibheal had fore-knowledge of the outcome and tried to
  warn her people. Aoibheal is revered in many of the 'Aislings', the
  vision poems of the eighteenth century concerning the future freedom of
  Ireland.
<p>
  Cliodna is loved and cherished by the people of Co. Cork, where a number
  of place names are associated with her. She is the guardian goddess of
  the O'Keefes, and said to be the eldest daughter of the last Druid of
  Ireland. One of the three great waves mentioned in Irish mythology is
  Tonn Cliodna, the wave of Cliodna, off the coast at Glandore, Co. Cork.
  A legend tells of Ciabhan of the Curling Locks who took Cliodna out of
  the lands of Manannan and brought her to the shores of Ireland in his
  curragh. He left Cliodna alone on the shore while he went off to hunt
  deer; while he was gone Manannan sent a huge wave over the strand and
  Cliodna was drowned.
<p>
  In the north east of Leinster the fairy queen Grian of the Bright Cheeks
  has her abode on Cnoc Greine. The sidhe mound of her father was attacked
  once by the five sons of Conall. Grian pursued them and in revenge she
  transformed them into badgers. In the Irish sagas Grania eloped with
  Diarmaid, and all over Ireland there are cairns and cromlechs known
  locally as 'the bed of Diarmaid and Grania'. In Co. Tipperary, east of
  loch Derg, lies Knockshegouna, the fairy hill of Una. Una is the wife of
  the fairy king Finnbheara of Cnoc Meadha; she is a somewhat elusive
  figure, but nevertheless her sidhe dwelling was a very important place
  in former times, and she is still remembered by local people.

<h2>FAIRY KINGS OF IRELAND</h2>

  The great fairy king of Co. Galway in the west of Ireland is Finnbheara
  (Finnvarr). Cnoc Meadha is his abode, a prominent hill west of Tuam, on
  top of which is a burial mound. To the north west is Magh Tuireadh,
  where the legendary battle between the Fir Bolgs and the Tuatha De
  Danaans took place. There are many stories which illustrate Finnbheara's
  liking for earthly women. He would often draw young girls away to dance
  all night with him in his palace, but the next morning they were always
  found safely asleep in bed. One particular nobleman was not so fortunate,
  however. His bride was taken one time by the fairy king. The bride's old
  nurse told the noble that he must dig down into the sidhe mound,
  starting at the top. But during the night the fairies of the mound
  filled the tunnel back in with earth. This happened again on the second
  night. In despair the nobleman turned to the old nurse again, who told
  him to sprinkle the earth with salt and place a line of burning turf
  around the trench, as the sidhe could not resist that. The following
  morning the bride was found safe in her bed.
<p>
  Finnbheara is also known to love horses, and he is usually seen riding a
  black horse with flaring red nostrils. Some-times he would invite young
  men to ride with his fairy host.
<p>
  In Co. Limerick the fairy king Donn of Knockfierna is well remembered.
  There is a large earthern fort on his hill and a number of dolmens known
  as the 'Giants Graves'. You can see the entrance to his fairy palace.
  Donn is the ancient Celtic god of the Dead who rules the rocky islands
  to the south west on the Atlantic coast. Donn is also known in  Co.
  Fermanagh as the ancestor of the Maguires, whom he helped in their
  battles. Sometimes he is seen riding on a white horse on stormy nights,
  when people would exclaim: "Donn is galloping in the clouds tonight".
  Donn now more closely resembles a medieval Irish landlord than a god. He
  rules quite strictly but will aid his people when needed. He is also
  believed to fight against rival hosts in other counties, the winner
  carrying off the best potato crop for that year.
<p>
  It will be noted that the fairy queens and kings are in fact the old
  pagan gods and goddesses 'in disguise' who have long been revered by the
  Irish. I once heard someone state that the Celtic gods of Ireland had
  long been wiped out, buried under the sway of Catholicism. Yet anyone
  who has been to the Emerald Isle, or listened to her many folk tales can
  see for themselves that this is very far from the reality. The old gods
  live on in folk tales as the giants of the hill; the Gobhan Saor who
  built all the bridges of Ireland; the Gille Decair, a clown and
  trickster; the carl (serf) of the drab coat and many others. The old
  deities were once worshipped throughout Ireland, however it is in
  the west that they are best remembered now, the east having been more
  Christianized and anglicised, and subject to more invasions. By contrast,
  the west of Ireland, to which the native Irish were driven ("to hell or
  Connaught") has held on longer to her ancient heritage.

<h2>FAIRY WOMEN OF SCOTLAND</h2>

  There are many similarities to be found in the fairy lore of Scotland,
  no doubt due to the migration of peoples back and forth between Scotland
  and Ireland. Most people know about the last wave of Gaelic incomers
  into Scotland from Ireland in the fifth century, but for many centuries
  before this the Irish were intermarrying with the Cruithne (Picts) of
  Scotland and this is mentioned in some early texts. Thus there has been
  a long interchange between the two lands which has led to a mingling of
  folklore and belief.
<p>
  The most well known of the fairy women both in Ireland and Scotland has
  to be the Bean Sidhe, the Banshee. In Ireland she is the ancestress of
  the old aristocratic families, the Irish clans. When any death or
  misfortune is about to occur in the family, she will be heard wailing
  her unearthly lament. It was considered something of a status symbol to
  have a banshee attached to your family! She is more often heard than
  seen, though if you do catch sight of her she may be combing her long
  hair with a silver comb. She is also known as the bean chaointe, the
  wailing woman, and also as badhbh chaointe. Badhbh is the Irish for a
  scald crow, but more interestingly it is the name of one of the Celtic
  war goddesses who would shriek over the battlefields in the form of a
  crow.
<p>
  In the Highlands of Scotland this type of banshee is known as the bean
  tighe, the fairy housekeeper, or in some places as the Glaistig Uaine,
  the Green Lady, who is often sighted in the rooms and the grounds of the
  old castles of the Scottish clans, keeping watch over everything. There
  is also the wilder type of banshee found in the remoter places. This
  type of banshee wanders through the woods and over the moors at dusk,
  luring travellers to their doom.
<p>
  The gruagach is the fairy woman who watches over the cattle fold at
  night and protects the goodness of the milk. On Skye, Tiree and other
  islands are to be found 'gruagach stones', stones with hollows in where
  libations of milk were poured as an offering to her. If this daily
  offering was neglected, the best cow of the fold would be found dead
  in the morning. The Book of Arran mentions such a gruagach who minded
  the cattle in the district of Kilmory.
<p>
  There are many stories of sidhe women who help households with spinning,
  housework, threshing corn and so on. However, if they are interfered
  with in any way, even by the offering of a present, they will never
  return again. Alexander Carmichael mentions the 'bean chaol a chot uaine
  's na gruaige buidhe', the slender woman of the green kirtle and yellow
  hair, who can turn water into wine and weave spider's webs into plaide,
  and play sweet music on the fairy reed.
<p>
  We also find in Scotland the dreaded bean nighe, otherwise known as the
  Washer at the Ford. She may be seen at midnight washing the death shirt
  of someone about to die. Usually the person who meets her knows that it
  is his own fate that she foretells. As she washes she sings a dirge:
  "Se do leine, se do leine ga mi nigheadh"
  (It is your shirt, your shirt that I am washing).
<p>
  Many spirits of rivers and mountains in Scotland appear in the shape of
  an old hag, the Cailleach. The most famous is the Cailleach bheara who
  washes her clothes in the whirlpool of the Corryvreckan off Jura, and
  rides across the land in the form of the 'night mare'.
<p>
  There is another sidhe being that is mentioned in the writings of Fiona
  MacLeod and is greatly feared among the Gaels. He is the Amadan Dubh,
  the Fairy Fool, bringer of madness and oblivion. Sometimes he appears as
  a darkly clad figure on the slope of a hill after sunset, playing on his
  reed pipes a fairy enchantment.
<p>
  We may conclude, then, that within the fairy lore of Scotland and
  Ireland are to be found the remnants of the old pagan religion, with
  gods and goddesses being remembered as the guardian ancestors of the
  clans. In fact, all the clans once claimed descent from a particular
  deity, so this is nothing new. The old gods still appear in local tales,
  as kings and queens of fairy palaces, or as guardians of lakes. In
  other words, they are still very much part of the land and the folk
  memory of the people. Belief in the sidhe has been steadily diminishing,
  however, not least through the decline in the Gaelic language, and with
  it so many of the folk tales that were only ever told in the Gaelic. It
  is sad that the attitude of so many people of today is that these tales
  are merely children's stories, to be put aside when we grow older and
  wiser in years. How far from the truth this is, if only they could see
  it. The fairies are the elemental powers of the land, the ancient Earth
  Shapers who live in the hollow hills, to whom the world of Mankind
  is but a dream...
