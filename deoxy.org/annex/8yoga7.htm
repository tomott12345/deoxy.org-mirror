<H1>YOGA FOR YELLOWBELLIES<br>Third Lecture</H1>

Dear Children,
<P>
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.

<p>1. You will remember that last week our study of Yoga had
led us to the Fathers of the Church.  We saw that their philosophy
and science, in following an independent route, had brought us
to the famous exclamation of Tertullian:  'certum est quia ineptum!'
How right the Church has been to deny the authority of Reason!
<p>2. We are almost tempted to enquire for a moment what the
Church means by 'faith.'  St. Paul tells us that faith is 'the
substance of things hoped for; the evidence of things unseen.'
I do not think, then, that we are to imagine this word faith
to mean what that lecherous gross-bellied boor, Martin Luther,
maintained.  The faith of which he speaks is anything but a substance,
and as for evidence, it is nothing but the power, as the schoolboy
said, of believing that which we know to be untrue.  To have any
sensible meaning at all, faith must mean experience, and that
view is in exact accord with the conclusion to which we were led
in my last lecture.  Nothing is any use to us unless it be a certainty
unshakeable by criticism of any kind, and there is only one thing
in the universe which complies with these conditions:  the direct
experience of spiritual truth.  Here, and here only, do we find
a position in which the great religious minds of all times and
all climes coincide.  It is necessarily above dogma, because dogma
consists of a collection of intellectual statements, each of which,
and also its contradictory, can easily be disputed and overthrown.
<p>
3. You are probably aware that in the Society of Jesus the
postulants are trained to debate on all these highly controversial
subjects.  They put up a young man to prove any startling blasphemy
that happens to occur to them.  And the more shocked the young
man is, the better the training for his mind, and the better service
will he give to the Society in the end; but only if his mind has
been completely disabused of its confidence in its own rightness,
or even in the possibility of being right.
<p>
4. The rationalist, in his shallow fashion, always contends
that this training is the abnegation of mental freedom.  On the
contrary, it is the only way to obtain that freedom.  In the same
Society the training in obedience is based on a similar principle.
The priest has to do what his Superior orders him-'perinde ac
cadaver.'  Protestants always represent that this is the most
outrageous and indefensible tyranny.  'The poor devil,'
they say, 'is bludgeoned into having no will of his own.'  That
is pure nonsense.  By abnegating his will through the practice
of holy obedience his will has become enormously strong, so strong
that none of his natural instincts, desires, or habits can intrude.
He has freed his will of all these inhibitions.  He is a perfect
function of the machinery of the Order.  In the General of the
Society is concentrated the power of all those separate wills,
just as in the human body every cell should be completely devoted
in its particular quality to the concentrated will of the organism.
<p>
5. In other words, the Society of Jesus has created a perfect
imitation of the skeleton of the original creation, living man.
It has complied with the divinely instituted order of things,
and that is why we see that the body, which was never numerically
important, has yet been one of the greatest influences in the
development of Europe.  It has not always worked perfectly, but
that has not been the fault of the system; and, even as it is,
its record has been extraordinary.  And one of the most remarkable
things about it is that its greatest and most important achievements
have been in the domain of science and philosophy.  It has done
nothing in religion; or, rather, where it has meddled with religion
it has only done harm.  What a mistake!  And why?  For the simple
reason that it was in a position to take no notice of religion;
all these matters were decided for it by the Pope, or by the Councils
of the Church, and the Society was therefore able to free itself
from the perplexities of religion, in exactly the same way as
the novice obtains complete freedom from his moral responsibilities
by sinking his personal phantasies in the will of the Superior.
<p>
6. I should like to mention here that the Spiritual Exercises
of St. Ignatius are in their essence really admirable Yoga practices.
They have, it is true, a tinge of magical technique, and they
have been devised to serve a dogmatic end.  That was, however,
necessary, and it was good magic too, at that, because the original
will of the Founder was to produce a war engine as a counterblast
to the Reformation.  He was very wise to devise a plan, irrespective
of its abstract merits as philosophy, which would most efficiently
serve that single purpose.  The only trouble has been that this
purpose was not sufficiently cosmic in scope to resist internal
forces.  Having attained the higher planes by practice of these
exercises, they found that the original purpose of the Society
was not really adequate to their powers; they were, so to speak,
over-engined.  They stupidly invaded the spiritual sphere of the
other authorities whom they were founded to support, and thus
we see them actually quarrelling with the Pope, while failing
signally to obtain possession of the Papacy.  Being thus thwarted
in their endeavours, and confused in their purpose, they redoubled
the ardour of their exercises; and it is one of the characteristics
of all spiritual exercises, if honestly and efficiently performed,
that they constantly lead you on to higher planes, where all dogmatic
considerations, all intellectual concepts, are invalid.  Hence,
we found that it is not altogether surprising that the General
of the Order and his immediate circle have been supposed to be
atheists.  If that were true, it would only show that they have
been corrupted by their preoccupation with the practical politics
of the world, which it is impossible to conduct on any but an
atheistic basis; it is brainless hypocrisy to pretend otherwise,
and should be restricted to the exclusive use of the Foreign Office.
<p>It would, perhaps, be more sensible to suppose that the heads
of the Order have really attained the greatest heights of spiritual
knowledge and freedom, and it is quite possible that the best
term to describe their attitude would be either Pantheistic or
Gnostic.
<p>7. These considerations should be of the greatest use to us
now that we come to discuss in more detail the results of the
Yoga practices.  There is, it is true, a general similarity between
the ecstatic outbursts of the great mystics all over the world.
Comparisons have often been drawn by students of the subject.
I will only detain you with one example:  'Do what thou wilt
shall be the whole of the Law.'  What is this injunction?  It
is a generalisation of St.  Augustine's 'Love, and do what thou
wilt.'  But in 'The Book of the Law', lest the hearer should be
deluded into a spasm of antinomianism, there is a further explanation:
'Love is the law, love under will.'
<p>8. However, the point is that it is no use discussing the
results of Yoga, whether that Yoga be the type recommended by
Lao-Tze, or Patanjali, or St. Ignatius Loyola, because for our
first postulate we have:  that these subjects are incapable of
discussion.  To argue about them only causes us to fall into the
pit of Because, and there to perish with the dogs of Reason. 
The only use, therefore, of describing our experiences is to
enable students to get some sort of idea of the sort of thing
that is going to happen to them when they attain success in the
practices of Yoga.  We have David saying in the Psalms:  'I hate
thoughts, but Thy law do I love.'  We have St. Paul saying:  'The
carnal mind is enmity against God.'  One might almost say that
the essence of St. Paul's Epistles is a struggle against mind:
'We war not against flesh and blood'-you know the rest-I can't
be bothered to quote it all-Eph. vi. 12.
<p>9. It is St. Paul, I think, who describes Satan, which is
his name for the enemy, owing to his ignorance of the history
of the world, as the Prince of the Power of the Air; that is,
of the Ruach, of the intellect; and we must never forget that
what operated the conversion of St. Paul was the Vision on the
road to Damascus.  It is particularly significant that he disappeared
into the Desert of Arabia for three years before coming forward
as the Apostle to the Gentiles.  St. Paul was a learned Rabbi;
he was the favourite pupil of the best expositor of the Hebrew
Law, and in the single moment of his Vision all his arguments
were shattered at a single stroke!
<p>10. We are not told that St. Paul said anything at the time,
but went quietly on his journey.  That is the great lesson:  not
to discuss the results.  Those of you who possess a copy of 'The
Equinox of the Gods' may have been very much surprised at the
extraordinary injunction in the Comment:  the prohibition of all
discussion of the Book.  I myself did not fully understand that
injunction; I do so now.
<p>11. Let us now deal with a few of the phenomena which occur
during the practices of Pratyahara.
<p>Very early during my retirement in Kandy, I had been trying
to concentrate by slanting my eyes towards the tip of my nose.
This, by the way, is not a good practice; one is liable to strain
the eyes.  But what happened was that I woke up in the night;
my hand touched a nose; I immediately concluded that some one
was in the room.  Not at all; I only thought so because my nose
had passed away from the region of my observation by the practice
of concentrating upon it.
<p>12. The same sort of thing occurs with adequate concentration
on any object.  It is connected, curiously enough, with the phenomena
of invisibility.  When your mind has gone so deeply into itself
that it is unconscious of itself and its surroundings, one of
the most ordinary results is that the body becomes invisible to
other people.  I do not think that it would make any difference
for a photograph, though I have no evidence for saying this; but
it has happened to me on innumerable occasions.  It was an almost
daily occurrence when I was in Sicily.
<p>13. A party of us used to go down to a very beautiful bay
of sand, whence jutted fantastically-shaped islets of rock; it
is rimmed by cliffs encrusted with jewels of marine life.  The
way was over a bare hillside; except for a few hundred yards of
vineyard there was no cover-nay, not for a rabbit.  But it often
happened that one of the party would turn to speak to me, and
fail to see me.  I have often known this to happen when I was
dictating; my chair was apparently empty.
<p>Incidentally, this faculty, which I think is exercised, as
a rule, unconsciously, may become an actual magical power.
<p>14. It happened to me on one occasion that a very large number
of excited people were looking for me with no friendly intentions;
but I had a feeling of lightness, of ghostliness, as if I were
a shadow moving soundlessly about the street; and in actual fact
none of the people who were looking for me gave the slightest
indication that they were aware of my presence.
<p>There is a curious parallel to this incident in one of the
Gospels where we read that 'they picked up stones to stone him,
but he, passing through the midst of them, went his way.'
<p>15. There is another side to this business of Pratyahara,
one that may be described as completely contradictory against
what we have been talking about.
<p>If you concentrate your attention upon one portion of the
body with the idea of investigating it, that is, I suppose, allowing
the mind to move within very small limits, the whole of your consciousness
becomes concentrated in that small part.  I used to practise this
a good deal in my retirement by Lake Pasquaney.  I would usually
take a finger or a toe, and identify my whole consciousness with
the small movements which I allowed it to make.  It would be futile
to go into much detail about this experience.  I can only say
that until you acquire the power you have no idea of the sheer
wonder and delight of that endlessly quivering orgasm.
<p>16. If I remember rightly, this practice and its result were
one of the principal factors which enabled me afterwards to attain
what is called the Trance of Wonder, which pertains to the Grade
of a Master of the Temple, and is a sort of complete understanding
of the organism of the universe, and an ecstatic adoration of
its marvel.
<p>This Trance is very much higher than the Beatific Vision,
for always in the latter it is the heart-the Phren-which is involved;
in the former it is the Nous, the divine intelligence of man,
whereas the heart is only the centre of the intellectual and moral
faculties.
<p>17. But, so long as you are occupying yourself with the physical,
your results will only be on that plane; and the principal effect
of these concentrations on small parts of the body is the understanding,
or rather the appreciation, of sensuous pleasure.  This, however,
is infinitely refined, exquisitely intense.  It is often possible
to acquire a technique by which the skilled artist can produce
this pleasure in another person.  Map out, say, three square inches
of skin anywhere, and it is possible by extreme gentle touches
to excite in the patient all the possible sensations of pleasure
of which that person is capable.  I know that this is a very extraordinary
claim, but it is a very easy one to substantiate.  The only thing
I am afraid of is that experts may be carried away by the rewards,
instead of getting the real value of the lesson, which is that
the gross pleasures of the senses are absolutely worthless.
<p>This practice, so far as it is useful to all, should be regarded
as the first step towards emancipation from the thrall of the
bodily desires, of the sensations self-destructive, of the thirst
for pleasure.
<p>18. I think this is a good opportunity to make a little digression
in favour of Mahasatipatthana.  This practice was recommended
by the Buddha in very special terms, and it is the only one of
which he speaks so highly.  He told his disciples that if they
only stuck to it, sooner or later they would reach full attainment.
The practice consists of an analysis of the universe in terms
of consciousness.  You begin by taking some very simple and regular
bodily exercise, such as the movement of the body in walking,
or the movements of the lungs in breathing.  You keep on noting
what happens:  'I am breathing out; I am breathing in; I am holding
my breath,' as the case may be.  Quite without warning, one is
appalled by the shock of the discovery that what you have been
thinking is not true.  You have no right to say:  'I am breathing
in.'  All that you really know is that there is a breathing in.
<p>19. You therefore change your note, and you say:  'There is
a breathing in; there is a breathing out,' and so on.  And very
soon, if you practise assiduously, you get another shock.  You
have no right to say that there is a breathing.  All you know
is that there is a sensation of that kind.  Again you change your
conception of your observation, and one day make the discovery
that the sensation has disappeared.  All you know is that there
is perception of a sensation of breathing in or breathing out.
Continue, and that is once more discovered to be an illusion.
What you find is that there is a tendency to perceive a sensation
of the natural phenomena.
<p>20. The former stages are easy to assimilate intellectually;
one assents to them immediately that one discovers them, but with
regard to the 'tendency,' this is not the case, at least it was
not so for my own part.  It took me a long while before I understood
what was meant by 'tendency.'  To help you to realise this I should
like to find a good illustration.  For instance, a clock does
nothing at all but offer indications of the time.  It is so constructed
that this is all we can know about it.  We can argue about whether
the time is correct, and that means nothing at all, unless, for
example, we know whether the clock is controlled electrically
from an astronomical station where the astronomer happens to
be sane, and in what part of the world the clock is, and so on.
<p>21. I remember once when I was in Teng-Yueh, just inside the
Chinese frontier in Yunnan.  The hour of noon was always telegraphed
to the Consulate from Pekin.  This was a splendid idea, because
electricity is practically instantaneous.  The unfortunate thing
was, if it <em>was</em> unfortunate, which I doubt, that the messages
had to be relayed at a place called Yung Chang.  The operators
there had the good sense to smoke opium most of the time, so occasionally
a batch of telegrams would arrive, a dozen or so in a bunch, stating
that it was noon at Pekin on various dates!  So all the gross
phenomena, all these sensations and perceptions, are illusion.
All that one could really say was that there was a tendency on
the part of some lunatic in Pekin to tell the people at Teng-Yueh
what o'clock it was.
<p>
22. But even this Fourth Skandha is not final.  With practice,
it also appears as an illusion, and one remains with nothing but
the bare consciousness of the existence of such a tendency.
<p>I cannot tell you very much about this, because I have not
worked it out very thoroughly myself, but I very much doubt whether
'consciousness' has any meaning at all, as a translation of the
word Vinnanam.  I think that a better translation would be 'experience,'
used in the sense in which we have been using it hitherto, as
the direct reality behind and beyond all remark.
<p>23. I hope you will appreciate how difficult it is to give
a reasoned description, however tentative, of these phenomena,
still less to classify them properly.  They have a curious trick
of running one into the other.  This, I believe, is one of the
reasons why it has been impossible to find any really satisfactory
literature about Yoga at all.  The more advanced one's progress,
the less one knows, and the more one understands.  The effect
is simply additional evidence of what I have been saying all this
time:  that it is very little use discussing things; what is needed
is continuous devotion to the practice.
<P>
Love is the law, love under will.
