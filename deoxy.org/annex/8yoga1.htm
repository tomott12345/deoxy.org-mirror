<H1>YOGA FOR YAHOOS<br>
<font size="-1">First Lecture - First Principles</font></h1>


Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is my will to explain the subject of Yoga in clear language,
without resort to jargon or the enunciation of fantastic hypotheses,
in order that this great science may be thoroughly understood
as of universal importance.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For, like all great things, it is simple; but, like all great
things, it is masked by confused thinking; and, only too often,
brought into contempt by the machinations of knavery.
<ol>
<li>There is more nonsense talked and written about Yoga than
about anything else in the world.  Most of this nonsense, which
is fostered by charlatans, is based upon the idea that there is
something mysterious and Oriental about it.  There isn't.  Do
not look to me for obelisks and odalisques, Rahat Loucoum, bul-buls,
or any other tinsel imagery of the Yoga-mongers.  I am neat but
not gaudy.  There is nothing mysterious or Oriental about anything,
as everybody knows who has spent a little time intelligently in
the continents of Asia and Africa.  I propose to invoke the most
remote and elusive of all Gods to throw clear light upon the subject-the
light of common sense.
<p>
<li>All phenomena of which we are aware take place in our
own minds, and therefore the only thing we have to look at is
the mind; which is a more constant quantity over all the species
of humanity than is generally supposed.  What appear to be radical
differences, irreconcilable by argument, are usually found to
be due to the obstinacy of habit produced by generations of systematic
sectarian training.
<p>
<li>We must then begin the study of Yoga by looking at the
meaning of the word.  It means Union, from the same Sanskrit root
as the Greek word Zeugma, the Latin word Jugum, and the English
word yoke.  (Yeug-to join.)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When a dancing girl is dedicated to the service of a temple
there is a Yoga of her relations to celebrate.  Yoga, in short,
may be translated 'tea fight,' which doubtless accounts for the
fact that all the students of Yoga in England do nothing but gossip
over endless libations of Lyons' 1s. 2d.
<p>
<li>Yoga means Union.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In what sense are we to consider this?  How is the word Yoga to
imply a system of religious training or a description of religious
experience?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You may note incidentally that the word Religion is really identifiable
with Yoga.  It means a binding together.
<p>
<li>Yoga means Union.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What are the elements which are united or to be united when this
word is used in its common sense of a practice widely spread in
Hindustan whose object is the emancipation of the individual who
studies and practises it from the less pleasing features of his
life on this planet?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I say Hindustan, but I really mean anywhere on the earth; for
research has shown that similar methods producing similar results
are to be found in every country.  The details vary, but the general
structure is the same.  Because all bodies, and so all minds,
have identical Forms.
<p>
<li>Yoga means Union.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the mind of a pious person, the inferiority complex which accounts
for his piety compels him to interpret this emancipation as union
with the gaseous vertebrate whom he has invented and called God.
On the cloudy vapour of his fears his imagination has thrown
a vast distorted shadow of himself, and he is duly terrified;
and the more he cringes before it, the more the spectre seems
to stoop to crush him.  People with these ideas will never get
to anywhere but Lunatic Asylums and Churches.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is because of this overwhelming miasma of fear that the whole
subject of Yoga has become obscure.  A perfectly simple problem
has been complicated by the most abject ethical and superstitious
nonsense.  Yet all the time the truth is patent in the word itself.
<p>
<li>Yoga means Union.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We may now consider what Yoga really is.  Let us go for a moment
into the nature of consciousness with the tail of an eye on such
sciences as mathematics, biology, and chemistry.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In mathematics the expression 'a' plus 'b' plus 'c' is a triviality.
Write 'a' plus 'b' plus 'c' equals 0, and you obtain an equation
from which the most glorious truths may be developed.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In biology the cell divides endlessly, but never becomes anything
different; but if we unite cells of opposite qualities, male and
female, we lay the foundations of a structure whose summit is
unattainably fixed in the heavens of imagination.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Similar facts occur in chemistry.  The atom by itself has few
constant qualities, none of them particulary significant; but
as soon as an element combines with the object of its hunger we
get not only the ecstatic production of light, heat, and so forth,
but a more complex structure having few or none of the qualities
of its elements, but capable of further combination into complexities
of astonishing sublimity.  All these combinations, these unions,
are Yoga.

<p>
<li>Yoga means Union.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How are we to apply this word to the phenomena of mind?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the first characteristic of everything in thought?
How did it come to be a thought at all?  Only by making a distinction
between it and the rest of the world.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The first proposition, the type of all propositions, is: S is
P. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There must be two things-different things-whose relation forms
knowledge.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yoga is first of all the union of the subject and the object of
consciousness:  of the seer with the thing seen.
<p>
<li>Now, there is nothing strange or wonderful about all this.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The study of the principles of Yoga is very useful to the average
man, if only to make him think about the nature of the world as
he supposes that he knows it.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Let us consider a piece of cheese.  We say that this has certain
qualities, shape, structure, colour, solidity, weight, taste,
smell, consistency and the rest; but investigation has shown that
this is all illusory.  Where are these qualities?  Not in the
cheese, for different observers give quite different accounts
of it.  Not in ourselves, for we do not perceive them in the absence
of the cheese.  All 'material things,' all impressions, are phantoms.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In reality the cheese is nothing but a series of electric charges.
 Even the most fundamental quality of all, mass, has been found
not to exist.  The same is true of the matter in our brains which
is partly responsible for these perceptions.  What then are these
qualities of which we are all so sure?  They would not exist without
our brains; they would not exist without the cheese.  They are
the results of the union, that is of the Yoga, of the seer and
the seen, of subject and object in consciousness as the philosophical
phrase goes.  They have no material existence; they are only names
given to the ecstatic results of this particular form of Yoga.
<p>
<li>I think that nothing can be more helpful to the student
of Yoga than to get the above proposition firmly established in his
subconscious mind.  About nine-tenths of the trouble in understanding
the subject is all this ballyhoo about Yoga being mysterious and
Oriental.  The principles of Yoga, and the spiritual results of
Yoga, are demonstrated in every conscious and unconscious happening.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 This is that which is written in 'The Book of the Law' -- Love is
the law, love under will -- for Love is the instinct to unite, and
the act of uniting.  But this cannot be done indiscriminately,
it must be done 'under will,' that is, in accordance with the
nature of the particular units concerned.  Hydrogen has no love
for Hydrogen; it is not the nature, or the 'true Will' of Hydrogen
to seek to unite with a molecule of its own kind.  Add Hydrogen
to Hydrogen:  nothing happens to its quality:  it is only its
quantity that changes.  It rather seeks to enlarge its experience
of its possibilities by union with atoms of opposite character,
such as Oxygen; with this it combines (with an explosion of light,
heat, and sound) to form water.  The result is entirely different
from either of the component elements, and has another kind of
'true Will,' such as to unite (with similar disengagement of light
and heat) with Potassium, while the resulting 'caustic Potash'
has in its turn a totally new series of qualities, with still
another 'true Will' of its own; that is, to unite explosively
with acids.  And so on.
<p>
<li>It may seem to some of you that these explanations have
rather knocked the bottom out of Yoga; that I have reduced it
to the category of common things.  That was my object.  There
is no sense in being frightened of Yoga, awed by Yoga, muddled
and mystified by Yoga, or enthusiastic over Yoga.  If we are to
make any progress in its study, we need clear heads and the impersonal
scientific attitude.  It is especially important not to bedevil
ourselves with Oriental jargon.  We may have to use a few Sanskrit
words; but that is only because they have no English equivalents;
and any attempt to translate them burdens us with the connotations
of the existing English words which we employ.  However, these
words are very few; and, if the definitions which I propose to
give you are carefully studied, they should present no difficulty.
<p>
<li>Having now understood that Yoga is the essence of all
phenomena whatsoever, we may ask what is the special meaning of
the word in respect of our proposed investigation, since the process
and the results are familiar to every one of us; so familiar indeed
that there is actually nothing else at all of which we have any
knowledge.  It <em>is</em> knowledge.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is it we are going to study, and why should we study
it?
<p>
<li>The answer is very simple.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
All this Yoga that we know and practice, this Yoga that produced
these ecstatic results that we call phenomena, includes among
its spiritual emanations a good deal of unpleasantness.  The more
we study this universe produced by our Yoga, the more we collect
and synthesize our experience, the nearer we get to a perception
of what the Buddha declared to be characteristic of all component
things:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sorrow, Change, and Absence of any permanent principle.  We constantly
approach his enunciation of the first two 'Noble Truths,' as he
called them.  'Everything is Sorrow'; and 'The cause of Sorrow
is Desire.'  By the word 'Desire' he meant exactly what is meant
by 'Love' in 'The Book of the Law' which I quoted a few moments
ago.  'Desire' is the need of every unit to extend its experience
by combining with its opposite.
<p>
<li>It is easy enough to construct the whole series of arguments
which lead up to the first 'Noble Truth.'
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every operation of Love is the satisfaction of a bitter hunger,
but the appetite only grows fiercer by satisfaction; so that we
can say with the Preacher:  'He that increaseth knowledge increaseth
Sorrow.'  The root of all this sorrow is in the sense of insufficiency;
the need to unite, to lose oneself in the beloved object, is the
manifest proof of this fact, and it is clear also that the satisfaction
produces only a temporary relief, because the process expands
indefinitely.  The thirst increases with drinking.  The only complete
satisfaction conceivable would be the Yoga of the atom with the
entire universe.  This fact is easily perceived, and has been
constantly expressed in the mystical philosophies of the West;
the only goal is 'Union with God.'  Of course, we only use the
word 'God' because we have been brought up in superstition, and
the higher philosophers both in the East and in the West have
preferred to speak of union with the All or with the Absolute.
 More superstitions!
<p>
<li>Very well, then, there is no difficulty at all; since
every thought in our being, every cell in our bodies, every electron
and proton of our  atoms, is nothing but Yoga and the result of
Yoga.  All we have to do to obtain emancipation, satisfaction,
everything we want is to perform this universal and inevitable
operation upon the Absolute itself.  Some of the more sophisticated
members of my audience may possibly be thinking that there is
a catch in it somewhere.  They are perfectly right.
<p>
<li>The snag is simply this.  Every element of which we are
composed is indeed constantly occupied in the satisfaction of
its particular needs by its own particular Yoga; but for that
very reason it is completely obsessed by its own function, which
it must naturally consider as the Be-All and End-All of its existence.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 For instance, if you take a glass tube open at both ends and
put it over a bee on the windowpane it will continue beating against
the window to the point of exhaustion and death, instead of escaping
through the tube.  We must not confuse the necessary automatic
functioning of any of our elements with the true Will which is
the proper orbit of any star.  A human being only acts as a unit
at all because of countless generations of training.  Evolutionary
processes have set up a higher order of Yogic action by which
we have managed to subordinate what we consider particular interests
to what we consider the general welfare.  We are communities;
and our well-being depends upon the wisdom of our Councils, and
the discipline with which their decisions are enforced.  The more
complicated we are, the higher we are in the scale of evolution,
the more complex and difficult is the task of legislation and
of maintaining order.
<p>
<li>In highly civilised communities like our own (<em>loud laughter</em>),
the individual is constantly being attacked by conflicting interests
and necessities; his individuality is constantly being assailed
by the impact of other people; and in a very large number of cases
he is unable to stand up to the strain.  'Schizophrenia,' which
is a lovely word, and may or may not be found in your dictionary,
is an exceedingly common complaint.  It means the splitting up
of the mind.  In extreme cases we get the phenomena of multiple
personality, Jekyll and Hyde, only more so.  At the best, when
a man says 'I' he refers only to a transitory phenomenon.  His
'I' changes as he utters the word.  But-philosophy apart-it is
rarer and rarer to find a man with a mind of his own and a will
of his own, even in this modified sense.
<p>
<li>I want you therefore to see the nature of the obstacles
to union with the Absolute.  For one thing, the Yoga which we
constantly practice has not invariable results; there is a question
of attention, of investigation, of reflexion.  I propose to deal
in a future instruction with the modifications of our perception
thus caused, for they are of great importance to our science of
Yoga.  For example, the classical case of the two men lost in
a thick wood at night.  One says to the other:  'That dog barking
is not a grasshopper; it is the creaking of a cart.'  Or again,
'He thought he saw a banker's clerk descending from a bus.  He
looked again, and saw it was a hippopotamus.'
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Everyone who has done any scientific investigation knows painfully
how every observation must be corrected again and again.  The
need of Yoga is so bitter that it blinds us.  We are constantly
tempted to see and hear what we want to see and hear.
<p>
<li>It is therefore incumbent upon us, if we wish to make
the universal and final Yoga with the Absolute, to master every
element of our being, to protect it against all civil and external
war, to intensify every faculty to the utmost, to train outselves
in knowledge and power to the utmost; so that at the proper moment
we may be in perfect condition to fling ourselves up into the
furnace of ecstasy which flames from the abyss of annihilation.
