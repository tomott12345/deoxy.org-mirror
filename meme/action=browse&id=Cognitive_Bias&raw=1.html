+++Cognitive bias is a general term used to describe many distortions in\
the human mind that are difficult to eliminate and that lead to [http://deoxy.org/videx?q=conspiracy+OR+paranoia+OR+paranoid perceptual distortion, inaccurate judgment, or illogical interpretation.]+++
,,
,,
,,
== * &amp;gt; DECISIONS / BEHAVIOR ==

Many of these biases are studied for how they affect belief formation, business
decisions, and scientific research.

bills).
----
== * '''Distinction bias''' == the tendency to view two options as more dissimilar\
when evaluating them simultaneously than when evaluating them\
separately.

----
== * '''Expectation bias''' == the\

with their expectations for the outcome of an experiment, and to disbelieve,\
discard, or downgrade the corresponding weightings for data that appear to\
conflict with those expectations.
----
== * '''Extraordinarity bias''' == the tendency to value an object more than\
others in the same category as a result of an extraordinarity of that object\
that does not, in itself, change the value.

the utility associated with acquiring it&quot;.
----
== * '''Mere exposure effect''' == the tendency to express undue liking for things\

are altered by past events, when in reality they are unchanged. Results from\
an erroneous conceptualization of the Law of large numbers. For example, &quot;I've\

overestimate the probability of a favorable outcome coming to pass in a given\
situation.
----
== * '''Pareidolia''' == a vague and random stimulus (often an image or sound) is\

,,
,,
,,
== * &amp;gt; SOCIAL BIASES ==

Most of these biases are labeled as attributional biases.
----
== * '''Actor–observer bias''' == the tendency for explanations of other\
individuals' behaviors to overemphasize the influence of their personality and\
underemphasize the influence of their situation. However, this is coupled with \
the opposite tendency for\
the self in that explanations for our own behaviors overemphasize the\
influence of our situation and underemphasize the influence of our own\
personality.
----
== * '''Dunning–Kruger effect''' == a twofold bias. On one hand the lack of\
metacognitive ability deludes people, who overrate their capabilities. On the\
other hand, skilled people underrate their abilities, as they assume the\
others have a similar understanding.
----
== * '''Egocentric bias''' == occurs when people claim more responsibility for\
themselves for the results of a joint action than an outside observer would.

to &quot;spill over&quot; from one area of their personality to another in others'\
perceptions of them.
----
== * '''Herd instinct''' == common tendency to adopt the opinions and follow the\
behaviors of the majority to feel safer and to avoid conflict.
----
== * '''Illusion of asymmetric insight''' == people perceive their knowledge of\
their peers to surpass their peers' knowledge of them.
----
== * '''Illusion of transparency''' == people overestimate others' ability to know\
them, and they also overestimate their ability to know others.
----
== * '''Illusory superiority''' == overestimating one's desirable qualities, and\
underestimating undesirable qualities, relative to other people. (Also known\
as &quot;Lake Wobegon effect,&quot; &quot;better-than-average effect,&quot; or &quot;superiority\
bias&quot;).
----
== * '''Ingroup bias''' == the tendency for people to give preferential treatment\
to others they perceive to be members of their own groups.
----
== * '''Just-world phenomenon''' == the tendency for people to believe that the\
world is just and therefore people &quot;get what they deserve.&quot;
----
== * '''Moral luck''' == the tendency for people to ascribe greater or lesser\
moral standing based on the outcome of an event rather than the intention.
----

one's future selves) share one's current emotional states, thoughts and\
values.
----
== * '''Self-serving bias''' == the tendency to claim more responsibility for\
successes than failures. It may also manifest itself as a tendency for people\
to evaluate ambiguous information in a way beneficial to their interests.
----
== * '''System justification''' == the tendency to defend and bolster the status\
quo. Existing social, economic, and political arrangements tend to be\
preferred, and alternatives disparaged sometimes even at the expense of\
individual and collective self-interest.
----
== * '''Trait ascription bias''' == the tendency for people to view themselves as\
relatively variable in terms of personality, behavior and mood while viewing\
others as much more predictable.
----
== * '''Ultimate attribution error''' == similar to the fundamental attribution\
error, in this error a person is likely to make an internal attribution to an\
entire group instead of the individuals within the group.
----
,,
,,
,,
== * &amp;gt; MEMORY ERRORS ==
----
== * '''Consistency bias''' == incorrectly remembering one's past attitudes and\
behavior as resembling present attitudes and behavior.
----
== * '''Cryptomnesia''' == a form of misattribution where a memory is mistaken for\
imagination.
----
== * '''Egocentric bias''' == recalling the past in a self-serving manner, e.g.\
remembering one's exam grades as being better than they were, or remembering a\
caught fish as being bigger than it was.
----
== * '''False memory''' == confusion of imagination with memory, or\
the confusion of true memories with false memories.
----
== * '''Hindsight bias''' == filtering memory of past events through present\
knowledge, so that those events look more predictable than they actually were;\
also known as the &quot;I-knew-it-all-along effect.&quot;
----
== * '''Reminiscence bump''' == the effect that people tend to recall more\
personal events from adolescence and early adulthood than from other lifetime\
periods.
----
== * '''Rosy retrospection''' == the tendency to rate past events more positively\
than they had actually rated them when the event occurred.
----
== * '''Self-serving bias''' == perceiving oneself responsible for desirable\
outcomes but not responsible for undesirable ones.
----
== * '''Suggestibility''' == a form of misattribution where ideas suggested by a\
questioner are mistaken for memory.
----
== * '''Telescoping effect''' == the effect that recent events appear to have\
occurred more remotely and remote events appear to have occurred more\
recently.
----
== * '''Von Restorff effect''' == the tendency for an item that &quot;stands out like a\
sore thumb&quot; to be more likely to be remembered than other items.
