<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. I have not spoken through this instrument before. We had to
wait until she was precisely tuned, as we send a narrow band vibration. We
greet you in the love and in the light of our infinite Creator.
We have watched your group. We have been called to your group, for you
have a need for the diversity of experiences in channeling which go with a
more intensive, or as you might call it, advanced approach to the system of
studying the pattern of the illusions of your body, your mind, and your
spirit, which you call seeking the truth. We hope to offer you a somewhat
different slant upon the information which is always and ever the same.
At this time we would be glad to attempt to speak to any subject or
question which those entities in the room may have potential use in the
requesting.<br>
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Do you have a specific purpose, and if so, could you tell us
something of what your purpose is?<br>
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. We communicate now. We are those who are of the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>Law of
One</a>. In our vibration the polarities are harmonized; the complexities are
simplified; the paradoxes have a solution. We are one. That is our nature
and our purpose.
We are old upon your planet and have served with varying degrees of
success in transmitting the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>Law of One</a>, of Unity, of Singleness to your
peoples. We have walked your planet. We have seen the faces of your
peoples. However, we now feel the great responsibility of staying in the
capacity of removing the distortions and powers that have been given to the
<a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>Law of One</a>. We will continue in this, until, shall we say, your cycle is
appropriately ended. If not this one, then the next. We are not a part of
time and, thus, are able to be with you in any of your times.<br>                                   
<p>
Does this give you enough information from which to extract our purpose,
my brother?<br>
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Yes. Thank you.<br>
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. We appreciate your vibrations. Is there another query?<br>
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> I’ve heard of the name “Ra” in connection with the Egyptians.
Are you connected with that Ra in any way?<br>
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. Yes, the connection is congruency. May we elucidate? What
do you not understand?<br>
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Could you give me a little more detail about your role with the
Egyptians?<br>
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. The identity of the vibration Ra is our identity. We as a group,
or what you would call a <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>social memory complex</a>, made contact with a race
of your planetary kind which you call Egyptians. Others from our density
made contact at the same time in South America, and the so-called “lost
cities” were their attempts to contribute to the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>Law of One</a>.
We spoke to one who heard and understood and was in a position to decree
the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>Law of One</a>. However, the priests and peoples of that era quickly
distorted our message, robbing it of the, shall we say, compassion with
which unity is informed by its very nature. Since it contains all, it cannot
abhor any.<br>
<p>
When we were no longer able to have appropriate channels through which
to enunciate the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>Law of One</a>, we removed ourselves from the now
hypocritical position which we had allowed ourselves to be placed in. Other
myths, shall we say, having more to do with polarity and the things of your
vibration that are complex, again took over in that particular
society/complex.<br>

<H2><a name='BALANCE'></a><u>BALANCE</u></H2>
 
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Can you tell me a little more about the word, “balancing,” as
we are using it?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. Picture, if you will, the One Infinite. You have no picture.
Thus, the process begins. <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>Love</a> creating light, becoming <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>love/light</a>, streams
into the planetary sphere according to the electromagnetic web of points or
nexi of entrance. These streamings are then available to the individual who,
like the planet, is a web of electromagnetic energy fields with points or nexi
of entrance.
<p>
In a balanced individual each energy center is balanced and functioning
brightly and fully. The blockages of your planetary sphere cause some
distortion of <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>intelligent energy</a>. The blockages of the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>mind/body/spirit
complex</a> further distort or unbalance this energy. There is one energy. It
may be understood as <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>love/light</a> or <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>light/love</a> or <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>intelligent energy</a>.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Am I correct to assume that one of the blockages of the
mind/body/spirit complex might be, shall we say, ego, and this could be
balanced using a worthiness/unworthiness balance. Am I correct?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. This is incorrect.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Can you tell me how you balance the ego?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. We cannot work with this concept as it is misapplied and
understanding cannot come from it.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> How does an individual go about balancing himself? What is
the first step?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. The steps are only one; that is, an understanding of the energy
centers which make up the mind/body/spirit complex. This understanding
may be briefly summarized as follows. The first balancing is of the Malkuth,
or Earth, vibratory energy complex, called the red-ray complex. An
understanding and acceptance of this energy is fundamental. The next
energy complex, which may be blocked is the emotional, or personal
complex, also known as the orange-ray complex. This blockage will often
demonstrate itself as personal eccentricities or distortions with regard to selfconscious
understanding or acceptance of self.
<p>
The third blockage resembles most closely that which you have called ego.
It is the yellow-ray or solar plexus center. Blockages in this center will often
manifest as distortions toward power manipulation and other social
behaviors concerning those close and those associated with the
mind/body/spirit complex. Those with blockages in these first three energy
centers, or nexi, will have continuing difficulties in ability to further their
seeking of the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>Law of One</a>.
<p>
The center of heart, or green-ray, is the center from which <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>third-density</a>
beings may springboard, shall we say, to infinite intelligence. Blockages in
this area may manifest as difficulties in expressing what you may call
universal love or compassion.
<p>
The blue-ray center of energy streaming is the center which, for the first
time, is outgoing as well as inpouring. Those blocked in this area may have
difficulty in grasping the spirit/mind complexes of its own entity and
further difficulty in expressing such understandings of self. Entities blocked
in this area may have difficulties in accepting communication from other
mind/body/spirit complexes.
<p>
The next center is the pineal or indigo-ray center. Those blocked in this
center may experience a lessening of the influx of <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>intelligent energy</a> due to
manifestations which appear as unworthiness. This is that of which you
spoke. As you can see, this is but one of many distortions due to the several
points of energy influx into the mind/body/spirit complex. The indigo-ray
balancing is quite central to the type of work which revolves about the spirit
complex, which has its influx then into the transformation or transmutation
of <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>third density</a> to <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>fourth density</a>, it being the energy center receiving the
least distorted outpourings of <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>love/light</a> from <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>intelligent energy</a> and also the
potential for the key to the gateway of <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>intelligent infinity</a>.
<p>
The remaining center of energy influx is simply the total expression of the
entity’s vibratory complex of mind, body, and spirit. It is as it will be,
“balanced” or “imbalanced” has no meaning at this energy level, for it gives
and takes in its own balance. Whatever the distortion may be, it cannot be
manipulated as can the others and, therefore, has no particular importance
in viewing the balancing of an entity.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> You previously gave us information on what we should do in
balancing. Is there any publishable information you can give us now about
particular exercises or methods of balancing these energy centers?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. The exercises given for publication seen in comparison with
the material now given are in total a good beginning. It is important to
allow each seeker to enlighten itself rather than for any messenger to
attempt in language to teach/learn for the entity, thus being teach/learner
and learn/teacher. This is not in balance with your <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>third density</a>. We learn
from you. We teach to you. Thus, we teach/learn. If we learned for you, this
would cause imbalance in the direction of the distortion of free will. There
are other items of information allowable. However, you have not yet
reached these items in your line of questioning and it is our belief/feeling
complex that the questioner shall shape this material in such a way that your
mind/body/spirit complexes shall have entry to it, thus we answer your
queries as they arise in your mind complex.

<p>
<br><i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> We have decided to accept, if offered, the honor/duty of
learning/teaching the healing process. I would ask as to the first step which
we should accomplish in becoming effective healers.<br>
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. We shall begin with the first of the three teachings/learnings.
We begin with the mental learn/teaching necessary for contact with
<a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>intelligent infinity</a>. The prerequisite of mental work is the ability to retain
silence of self at a steady state when required by the self. The mind must be
opened like a door. The key is silence.
<p>
Within the door lies an hierarchical construction you may liken unto
geography and in some ways geometry, for the hierarchy is quite regular,
bearing inner relationships.
<p>
To begin to master the concept of mental disciplines it is necessary to
examine the self. The polarity of your dimension must be internalized.
Where you find patience within your mind you must consciously find the
corresponding impatience and vice versa. Each thought a being has, has in
its turn an antithesis. The disciplines of the mind involve, first of all,
identifying both those things of which you approve and those things of
which you disapprove within yourself, and then balancing each and every
positive and negative charge with its equal. The mind contains all things.
Therefore, you must discover this completeness within yourself.
<p>
The second mental discipline is acceptance of the completeness within your
consciousness. It is not for a being of polarity in the physical consciousness
to pick and choose among attributes, thus building the roles that cause
blockages and confusions in the already distorted mind complex. Each
acceptance smoothes part of the many distortions that the faculty you call
judgment engenders.
<p>
The third discipline of the mind is a repetition of the first but with the gaze
outward toward the fellow entities that it meets. In each entity there exists
completeness. Thus, the ability to understand each balance is necessary.
When you view patience, you are responsible for mirroring in your mental
understandings, patience/impatience. When you view impatience, it is
necessary for your mental configuration of understanding to be
impatience/patience. We use this as a simple example. Most configurations
of mind have many facets, and understanding of either self polarities, or
what you would call other-self polarities, can and must be understood as
subtle work.
<p>
The next step is the acceptance of the other-self polarities, which mirrors
the second step. These are the first four steps of learning mental disciplines.
The fifth step involves observing the geographical and geometrical
relationships and ratios of the mind, the other mind, the mass mind, and
the infinite mind.
<p>
The second area of learn/teaching is the study/understanding of the body
complexes. It is necessary to know your body well. This is a matter of using
the mind to examine how the feelings, the biases, what you would call the
emotions, affect various portions of the body complex. It shall be necessary
to both understand the bodily polarity and to accept them, repeating in a
chemical/physical manifestation the work you have done upon the mind
bethinking the consciousness.
<p>
The body is a creature of the mind’s creation. It has its biases. The
biological bias must be first completely understood and then the opposite
bias allowed to find full expression in understanding. Again, the process of
acceptance of the body as a balanced, as well as polarized, individual may
then be accomplished. It is then the task to extend this understanding to the
bodies of the other-selves whom you will meet.
<p>
The simplest example of this is the understanding that each biological male
is female; each biological female is male. This is a simple example. However,
in almost every case wherein you are attempting the understanding of the
body of self or other-self, you will again find that the most subtle
discernment is necessary in order to fully grasp the polarity complexes
involved.
<p>
We proceed now with the third part of the teach/learning concerning the
development of the energy powers of healing.
<p>
The third area is the spiritual complex which embodies the fields of force
and consciousness which are the least distorted of your mind/body/spirit
complex. The exploration and balancing of the spirit complex is indeed the
longest and most subtle part of your learn/teaching. We have considered the
mind as a tree. The mind controls the body. With the mind single-pointed,
balanced, and aware, the body comfortable in whatever biases and
distortions make it appropriately balanced for that instrument, the
instrument is then ready to proceed with the greater work.
<p>
That is the work of wind and fire. The spiritual body energy field is a
pathway, or channel. When body and mind are receptive and open, then
the spirit can become a functioning shuttle or communicator from the
entity’s individual energy/will upwards, and from the streamings of the
creative fire and wind downwards.
<p>
The healing ability, like all other, what this instrument would call,
paranormal abilities, is affected by the opening of a pathway or shuttle into
<a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>intelligent infinity</a>. There are many upon your plane who have a random
hole or gateway in their spirit energy field, sometimes created by the
ingestion of chemicals such as, what this instrument would call LSD, who
are able, randomly and without control, to tap into energy sources. They
may or may not be entities who wish to serve. The purpose of carefully and
consciously opening this channel is to serve in a more dependable way, in a
more commonplace or usual way, as seen by the distortion complex of the
healer. To others there may appear to be miracles. To the one who has
carefully opened the door to intelligent infinity this is ordinary; this is
commonplace; this is as it should be. The life experience becomes somewhat
transformed. The great work goes on.
<p>
At this time we feel these exercises suffice for your beginning. We will, at a
future time, when you feel you have accomplished that which is set before
you, begin to guide you into a more precise understanding of the functions
and uses of this gateway in the experience of healing.

<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> I have a question here that I will read: “Much of
the mystic tradition of seeking on Earth holds the belief that the individual
self must be erased or obliterated and the material world ignored for the
individual to reach ‘nirvana,’ as it is called, or enlightenment. What is the
proper role of the individual self and its worldly activities to aid an
individual to grow more into the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>Law of One</a>?”
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. The proper role of the entity is in this density to experience all
things desired, to then analyze, understand, and accept these experiences,
distilling from them the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>love/light</a> within them. Nothing shall be overcome.
That which is not needed falls away.
<p>
The orientation develops due to analysis of desire. These desires become
more and more distorted towards conscious application of <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>love/light</a> as the
entity furnishes itself with distilled experience. We have found it to be
inappropriate in the extreme to encourage the overcoming of any desires,
except to suggest the imagination rather than the carrying out in the
physical plane, as you call it, of those desires not consonant with the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>Law of
One</a>, thus preserving the primal distortion of free will.
<p>
The reason it is unwise to overcome is that overcoming is an unbalanced
action creating difficulties in balancing in the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>time/space</a> continuum.
Overcoming, thus, creates the further environment for holding on to that
which apparently has been overcome.
<p>
All things are acceptable in the proper time for each entity, and in
experiencing, in understanding, in accepting, in then sharing with otherselves,
the appropriate distortion shall be moving away from distortions of
one kind to distortions of another which may be more consonant with the
<a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>Law of One</a>.
<p>
It is, shall we say, a shortcut to simply ignore or overcome any desire. It
must instead be understood and accepted. This takes patience and
experience which can be analyzed with care, with compassion for self and
for other-self.&#151;

<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> The key to balance may then be seen in the unstudied, spontaneous, and
honest response of entities toward experiences, thus using experience to the
utmost, then applying the balancing exercises and achieving the proper
attitude for the most purified spectrum of energy center manifestation in
violet ray. This is why the brilliance or rotational speed of the energy centers
is not considered above the balanced aspect or violet ray manifestation of an
entity in regarding <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>harvestability</a>; for those entities which are unbalanced,
especially as to the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>primary rays</a>, will not be capable of sustaining the impact
of the love and light of <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>intelligent infinity</a> to the extent necessary for
<a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>harvest</a>.&#151;
<br><br><img src="http://tn3-1.deviantart.com/fs5/300W/i/2004/311/1/4/The_Experiment_by_malice_gore.jpg" border="0" hspace="22" vspace="22" align="right">
<br><i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> I am going to make a statement and ask you to comment on its
degree of accuracy. I am assuming that the balanced entity would not be
swayed either towards positive or negative emotions by any situation which
he might confront. By remaining unemotional in any situation, the
balanced entity may clearly discern the appropriate and necessary responses
in harmony with the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>Law of One</a> for each situation. Is this correct?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. This is an incorrect application of the balancing which we
have discussed. The exercise of first experiencing feelings and then
consciously discovering their antitheses within the being has as its objective
not the smooth flow of feelings both positive and negative while remaining
unswayed but rather the objective of becoming unswayed. This is a simpler
result and takes much practice, shall we say.
<p>
The catalyst of experience works in order for the learn/teachings of this
density to occur. However, if there is seen in the being a response, even if it
is simply observed, the entity is still using the catalyst for learn/teaching.
The end result is that the catalyst is no longer needed. Thus this density is
no longer needed. This is not indifference or objectivity but a finely tuned
compassion and love which sees all things as love. This seeing elicits no
response due to catalytic reactions. Thus the entity is now able to become
co-Creator of experiential occurrences. This is the truer balance.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> I will attempt to make an analogy. If an animal, shall I say, a
bull, in a pen attacks you because you have wandered into his pen, you get
out of his way rapidly but you do not blame him. You do not have much of
an emotional response other than the response that he might damage you.
However, if you encounter another self in his territory and he attacks you,
your response may be more of an emotional nature creating physical bodily
responses. Am I correct in assuming that when your response to the animal
and to the other-self is that of seeing both as Creator and loving both and
understanding their action in attacking you is the action of their free will
then you have balanced yourself correctly in this area? Is this correct?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. This is basically correct. However, the balanced entity will see
in the seeming attack of an other-self the causes of this action which are, in
most cases, of a more complex nature than the cause of the attack of the
<a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>second-density</a> bull as was your example. Thus this balanced entity would
be open to many more opportunities for service to a <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>third-density</a> other-self.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Would a perfectly balanced entity feel any emotional response
in being attacked by the other-self?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. This is correct. The response is love.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> In the illusion that we now experience it is difficult to maintain
this response especially if the attack results in physical pain, but I assume
that this response should be maintained even through physical pain or loss
of life. Is this correct?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. This is correct and further is of a major or principle
importance in understanding, shall we say, the principle of balance. Balance
is not indifference but rather the observer not blinded by any feelings of
separation but rather fully imbued with love.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> In the last session you made the statement that “We, that is Ra,
spent much time/space in the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>fifth-density</a> balancing the intense
compassion that we had gained in the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>fourth-density</a>.” Could you expand
on this concept with respect to the material you just discussed?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. The <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>fourth-density</a>, as we have said, abounds in compassion.
This compassion is folly when seen through the eyes of wisdom. It is the
salvation of <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>third-density</a> but creates a mismatch in the ultimate balance of
the entity.
<p>
Thus we, as a <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>social memory complex</a> of <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>fourth-density</a>, had the tendency
towards compassion even to martyrdom in aid of other-selves. When the
<a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>fifth-density</a> <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>harvest</a> was achieved we found that in this vibratory level flaws
could be seen in the efficacy of such unrelieved compassion. We spent
much <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>time/space</a> in contemplation of those ways of the Creator which
imbue love with wisdom.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> I would like to try to make an analogy for <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>third-density</a> of this
concept. Many entities here feel great compassion for relieving the physical
problems of <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>third-density</a> other-selves by administering to them in many
ways, with food if there is hunger as there is now in the African nations, by
bringing them medicine if they feel that there is a need to minister to them
medically, and being selfless in all of these services to a very great extent.
<p>
This is creating a vibration that is in harmony with green-ray or <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>fourth-density</a>
but it is not balanced with the understanding of <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>fifth-density</a> that
these entities are experiencing catalysts and a more balanced administration
to their needs would be to provide them with the learning necessary to
reach the state of awareness of <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>fourth-density</a> than it would be to minister
to their physical needs at this time. Is this correct?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. This is incorrect. To a mind/body/spirit complex which is
starving, the appropriate response is the feeding of the body. You may
extrapolate from this.
<p>
On the other hand, however, you are correct in your assumption that the
green ray response is not as refined as that which has been imbued with
wisdom. This wisdom enables the entity to appreciate its contributions to
the planetary consciousness by the quality of its being without regard to
activity or behavior which expects results upon visible planes.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Then why do we have the extreme starvation problem in,
generally, the area of Africa at this time? Is there any metaphysical reason
for this, or is it purely random?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. Your previous assumption was correct as to the catalytic action
of this starvation and ill health. However, it is within the free will of an
entity to respond to this plight of otherselves, and the offering of the needed
foodstuffs and substances is an appropriate response within the framework
of your learn/teachings at this time which involve the growing sense of love
for and service to other-selves.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> What is the difference in terms of energy center activation
between a person who represses emotional responses to emotionally charged
situations and the person who is balanced and, therefore, truly unswayed by
emotionally charged situations?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. This query contains an incorrect assumption. To the truly
balanced entity no situation would be emotionally charged. With this
understood, we may say the following: The repression of emotions
depolarizes the entity in so far as it then chooses not to use the catalytic
action of the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>space/time</a> present in a spontaneous manner, thus dimming
the energy centers. There is, however, some polarization towards positive if
the cause of this repression is consideration for other-selves. The entity
which has worked long enough with the catalyst to be able to feel the
catalyst but not find it necessary to express reactions is not yet balanced but
suffers no depolarization due to the transparency of its experiential
continuum. Thus the gradual increase in the ability to observe one’s
reaction and to know the self will bring the self ever closer to a true balance.
<p>
Patience is requested and suggested, for the catalyst is intense upon your
plane and its use must be appreciated over a period of consistent
learn/teaching.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> How can a person know when he is unswayed by an
emotionally charged situation or if he is repressing the flow of emotions, or
if he is in balance and truly unswayed?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. We have spoken to this point. Therefore, we shall briefly
iterate that to the balanced entity no situation has an emotional charge but
is simply a situation like any other in which the entity may or may not
observe an opportunity to be of service. The closer an entity comes to this
attitude the closer an entity is to balance. You may note that it is not our
recommendation that reactions to catalyst be repressed or suppressed unless
such reactions would be a stumbling block not consonant with the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>Law of
One</a> to an other-self. It is far, far better to allow the experience to express
itself in order that the entity may then make fuller use of this catalyst.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> How can an individual assess what energy centers within its
being are activated and in no immediate need of attention and which energy
centers are not activated and are in need of immediate attention?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. The thoughts of an entity, its feelings or emotions, and least of
all its behavior are the signposts for the teaching/learning of self by self. In
the analysis of one’s experiences of a diurnal cycle an entity may assess what
it considers to be inappropriate thoughts, behaviors, feelings, and emotions.
In examining these inappropriate activities of mind, body, and spirit
complexes the entity may then place these distortions in the proper
vibrational ray and thus see where work is needed.&#151;
<br><br><br><img src="http://tn3-1.deviantart.com/fs15/300W/f/2007/023/e/4/Balance_by_Pixelnase.jpg" border="0" hspace="22" vspace="22" align="right">
<br><i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> I am going to make a statement and have you comment on it for its
correctness. The statement is: When the Creator’s light is split or divided
into colors and energy centers for experience, then in order to reunite with
the Creator the energy centers must be balanced exactly the same as the split
light was as it originated from the Creator. Is this correct?
<br><br><br><i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. To give this query a simple answer would be nearly
impossible.
<p>
We shall simplify by concentrating upon what we consider to be the central
idea towards which you are striving. We have, many times now, spoken
about the relative importance of balancing as opposed to the relative
unimportance of maximal activation of each energy center. The reason is as
you have correctly surmised. Thusly the entity is concerned, if it be upon
the path of positive <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>harvestability</a>, with the regularizing of the various
energies of experience. Thus the most fragile entity may be more balanced
than one with extreme energy and activity in service-to-others due to the
fastidiousness with which the will is focused upon the use of experience in
knowing the self. The densities beyond your own give the minimally
balanced individual much <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>time/space</a> and <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>space/time</a> with which to
continue to refine these inner balances.&#151;
<br><br><br><img src="http://tn3-2.deviantart.com/300W/images3.deviantart.com/i/2004/168/4/b/IMPERIAL.jpg" border="0" hspace="12" vspace="12" align="left">
<br><i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> I would like to ask questions about healing exercises. The first
is, in the healing exercises concerning the body, what do you mean by the
disciplines of the body having to do with the balance between love and
wisdom in the use of the body in its natural functions?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. We shall speak more briefly than usual due to this
instrument’s use of the transferred energy. We, therefore, request further
queries if our reply is not sufficient.
<p>
The body complex has natural functions. Many of these have to do with the
unmanifested self and are normally not subject to the need for balancing.
There are natural functions which have to do with other-self. Among these
are touching, loving, the sexual life, and those times when the company of
another is craved to combat the type of loneliness which is the natural
function of the body as opposed to those types of loneliness which are of the
mind/emotion complex or of the spirit.
<p>
When these natural functions may be observed in the daily life they may be
examined in order that the love of self and love of other-self versus the
wisdom regarding the use of natural functions may be observed. There are
many fantasies and stray thoughts which may be examined in most of your
peoples in this balancing process.
<p>
Equally to be balanced is the withdrawal from the need for these natural
functions with regard to other-self. On the one hand there is an excess of
love. It must be determined whether this is love of self or other-self or both.
On the other hand there is an over-balance towards wisdom.
<p>
It is well to know the body complex so that it is an ally, balanced and ready
to be clearly used as a tool, for each bodily function may be used in higher
and higher, if you will, complexes of energy with other-self. No matter what
the behavior, the important balancing is the understanding of each
interaction on this level with other-selves so that whether the balance may
be love/wisdom or wisdom/love, the other-self is seen by the self in a
balanced configuration and the self is thus freed for further work.&#151;
<br><br><br><img src="http://img1.jurko.net/avatar_6035.jpg" border="0" hspace="22" vspace="22" align="right">
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> The last question here says that it would seem the proper
balancing exercises for all the sensations of the body would be some sort of
inactivity such as meditation or contemplation. Is this correct?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. This is largely incorrect. The balancing requires a meditative
state in order for the work to be done. However, the balancing of sensation
has to do with an analysis of the sensation with especial respect to any
unbalanced leaning between the love and the wisdom or the positive and
the negative. Then whatever is lacking in the balanced sensation is, as in all
balancing, allowed to come into the being after the sensation is remembered
and recalled in such detail as to overwhelm the senses.&#151;
<br><br><img src="http://tn3-2.deviantart.com/300W/i/2003/46/d/d/balance.jpg" border="0" hspace="12" vspace="12" align="left">
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> I have a question here from (name). It states: “As we see
compassion developing in ourselves is it more appropriate to balance this
compassion with wisdom or to allow the compassion to develop as much as
possible without being balanced”?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. This query borders upon that type of question to which
answers are unavailable due to the free-will prohibitions upon information
from teach/learners.
<p>
To the student of the balancing process we may suggest that the most
stringent honesty be applied. As compassion is perceived it is suggested that,
in balancing, this perception be analyzed. It may take many, many essays
into compassion before true universal love is the product of the attempted
opening and crystallization of this all-important springboard energy center.
Thus the student may discover many other components to what may seem
to be all-embracing love. Each of these components may be balanced and
accepted as part of the self and as transitional material as the entity’s seat of
learn/teaching moves ever more clearly into the green ray.
<p>
When it is perceived that universal love has been achieved the next
balancing may or may not be wisdom. If the adept is balancing
manifestations it is indeed appropriate to balance universal love and
wisdom. If the balancing is of mind or spirit there are many subtleties to
which the adept may give careful consideration. Love and wisdom, like love
and light, are not black and white, shall we say, but faces of the same coin,
if you will. Therefore, it is not, in all cases, that balancing consists of a
movement from compassion to wisdom.
<p>
We may suggest at all times the constant remembrance of the density from
which each adept desires to move. This density learns the lessons of love. In
the case of <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>Wanderers</a> there are half-forgotten overlays of other lessons and
other densities. We shall leave these considerations with the questioner and
invite observations which we shall then be most happy to respond to in
what may seem to be a more effectual manner.&#151;
<br><br><img src="http://img1.jurko.net/avatar_2326.gif" border="0" hspace="22" vspace="22" align="right">
<br><i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> I have a question from Jim and it states: “I think that I have
penetrated my lifelong mystery of my anger at making mistakes. I think that
I have always been aware subconsciously of my ability to master new
learning, but my desire to successfully complete my work on Earth has been
energized by the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>Orion group</a> into irrational and destructive anger when I
fail. Could you comment on this observation"?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. We would suggest that as this entity is aware of its position as
a <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>Wanderer</a>, it may also consider what pre-incarnative decisions it
undertook to make regarding the personal or self-oriented portion of the
choosing to be here at this particular <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>time/space</a>. This entity is aware, as
stated, that it has great potential, but potential for what? This is the preincarnative
question. The work of <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>sixth-density</a> is to unify wisdom and
compassion. This entity abounds in wisdom. The compassion it is desirous
of balancing has, as its antithesis, lack of compassion. In the more conscious
being this expresses or manifests itself as lack of compassion for self. We feel
this is the sum of suggested concepts for thought which we may offer at this
time without infringement.&#151;

<br><br><i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Is it possible by the use of some technique or other to help an
entity to reach <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>fourth-density</a> level in these last days?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. It is impossible to help another being directly. It is only
possible to make catalyst available in whatever form, the most important
being the radiation of realization of oneness with the Creator from the self,
less important being information such as we share with you.
<p>
We, ourselves, do not feel an urgency for this information to be widely
disseminated. It is enough that we have made it available to three, four, or
five. This is extremely ample reward, for if one of these obtains <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>fourth density</a>
understanding due to this catalyst then we shall have fulfilled the
<a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>Law of One</a> in the distortion of service.
<p>
We encourage a dispassionate attempt to share information without
concern for numbers or quick growth among others. That you attempt to
make this information available is, in your terms, your service. The attempt,
if it reaches one, reaches all.
<p>
We cannot offer shortcuts to enlightenment. Enlightenment is, of the
moment, an opening to <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>intelligent infinity</a>. It can only be accomplished by
the self, for the self. Another self cannot teach/learn enlightenment, but
only teach/learn information, inspiration, or a sharing of love, of mystery,
of the unknown that makes the other-self reach out and begin the seeking
process that ends in a moment, but who can know when an entity will open
the gate to the present?&#151;
<br><br><img src="http://img1.jurko.net/9425.jpg" border="0" hspace="22" vspace="22" align="right">
<br><i><b><big>Questioner:</b></i></big> I will make a statement then of my understanding and ask you
if I am correct. There is a, what I would call, physical catalyst operating at
all times upon the entities in <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>third density</a>. I assume this operates
approximately the same way in <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>second density</a>. It is a catalyst which acts
through what we call pain and emotion. Is the primary reason for the
weakening of the physical body and the elimination of body hair, etc. so
that this catalyst would act more strongly upon the mind and therefore
create the evolutionary process?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. This is not entirely correct, although closely associated with
the distortions of our understanding.
<p>
Consider, if you will, the tree for instance. It is self-sufficient. Consider, if
you will, the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>third-density</a> entity. It is self-sufficient only through difficulty
and deprivation. It is difficult to learn alone for there is a built-in handicap,
at once the great virtue and the great handicap of <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>third density</a>. That is the
rational/intuitive mind.
<p>
Thus, the weakening of the physical vehicle, as you call it, was designed to
distort entities towards a predisposition to deal with each other. Thus, the
lessons which approach a knowing of love can be begun.
<p>
This catalyst then is shared between peoples as an important part of each
self’s development as well as the experiences of the self in solitude and the
synthesis of all experience through meditation. The quickest way to learn is
to deal with other-selves. This is a much greater catalyst than dealing with
the self. Dealing with the self without other-selves is akin to living without
what you would call mirrors. Thus, the self cannot see the fruits of its
being-ness. Thus, each may aid each by reflection. This is also a primary
reason for the weakening of the physical vehicle, as you call the physical
complex.&#151;

<br><i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Thank you. As we near the end of this <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>master cycle</a> there may
be an increasing amount of catalyst for entities. I am wondering if, as the
planetary vibrations mismatch somewhat with the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>fourth-density</a> vibrations
and catalyst is increased, if this will create more polarization thereby getting
a slightly greater <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>harvest</a>?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. The question must be answered in two parts. Firstly, the
planetary catastrophes, as you may call them, are a symptom of the difficult
<a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>harvest</a> rather than a consciously programmed catalyst for <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>harvest</a>. Thus we
do not concern ourselves with it, for it is random in respect to conscious
catalyst such as we may make available.
<p>
The second portion is this: the results of the random catalyst of what you
call the earth changes are also random. Thus we may see
probability/possibility vortices going towards positive and negative.
However, it will be as it will be. The true opportunities for conscious
catalyst are not a function of the earth changes but of the result of the
seniority system of incarnations which at the time of the harvest has placed
in incarnation those whose chances of using life experiences to become
<a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>harvestable</a> are the best.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Is this seniority system also used in the service to self side for
becoming <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>harvestable</a> on that side?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. This is correct. You may ask one more full question at this
time.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> What I would like for you to do is list all the major
mechanisms designed to provide catalytic experience that do not include
interaction with other-self. That is the first part.
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. We grasp from this question that you realize that the primary
mechanism for catalytic experience in <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>third-density</a> is other-self. The list of
other catalytic influences: firstly, the Creator’s universe; secondly, the self.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Can you list any sub-headings under self or ways the self is
acted upon catalytically which would produce experience?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. Firstly, the self unmanifested. Secondly, the self in relation to
the societal self created by self and other-self. Thirdly, the interaction
between self and the gadgets, toys, and amusements of the self, other-self
invention. Fourthly, the self relationship with those attributes which you
may call war and rumors of war.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> I was thinking possibly of the catalyst of physical pain. Does
this go under this heading?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. This is correct, it going under the heading of the unmanifested
self; that is, the self which does not need other-self in order to manifest or
act.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Do we have enough time left to ask the second part of this
question which is to list all major mechanisms designed to provide the
catalyst that include action with other-self?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. You have much time for this, for we may express this list in
one of two ways. We could speak infinitely, or we could simply state that
any interaction betwixt self and other-self has whatever potential for catalyst
that there exists in the potential difference between self and other-self, this
moderated and undergirded by the constant fact of the Creator as self and
as other-self. You may ask to this question further if you wish specific

<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> I believe that this is sufficient for the time being.&#151;
<br><br><img src="http://tn3-1.deviantart.com/fs8/300W/i/2005/317/7/9/Cosmo_1_by_rabbitica.jpg" border="0" hspace="22" vspace="22" align="right">
<br><i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Can you give me examples of catalytic action from
the last session beginning with the self unmanifested producing learning
catalyst?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. We observed your interest in the catalyst of pain. This
experience is most common among your entities. The pain may be of the
physical complex. More often it is of the mental and emotional complex. In
some few cases the pain is spiritual in complex-nature. This creates a
potential for learning. The lessons to be learned vary. Almost always these
lessons include patience, tolerance, and the ability for the light touch.
<p>
Very often the catalyst for emotional pain, whether it be the death of the
physical complex of one other-self which is loved or other seeming loss, will
simply result in the opposite, in a bitterness and impatience, a souring. This
is catalyst which has gone awry. In these cases then there will be additional
catalyst provided to offer the unmanifested self further opportunities for
discovering the self as all-sufficient Creator containing all that there is and
full of joy.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Do what we call contagious diseases play any part in this
process with respect to the unmanifested self?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. These so-called contagious diseases are those entities of
<a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>second-density</a> which offer an opportunity for this type of catalyst. If this
catalyst is unneeded, then these <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>second-density</a> creatures, as you would call
them, do not have an effect. In each of these generalizations you may please
note that there are anomalies so that we cannot speak to every circumstance
but only to the general run or way of things as you experience them.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> What part do what we call birth defects play in this process?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. This is a portion of the programming of the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>mind/body/spirit
complex totality</a> manifested in the mind/body/spirit of <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>third-density</a>. These
defects are planned as limitations which are part of the experience intended
by the entity’s totality complex. This includes genetic predispositions, as
you may call them.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Thank you. Can you give me the same type of information
about the self in relation to the societal self?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. The unmanifested self may find its lessons those which
develop any of the energy influx centers of the mind/body/spirit complex.
<p>
The societal and self interactions most often concentrate upon the second
and third energy centers. Thus those most active in attempting to remake or
alter the society are those working from feelings of being correct personally
or of having answers which will put power in a more correct configuration.
This may be seen to be of a full travel from negative to positive in
orientation. Either will activate these energy ray centers.
<p>
There are some few whose desires to aid society are of a green ray nature or
above. These entities, however, are few due to the understanding, may we
say, of fourth ray that universal love freely given is more to be desired than
principalities or even the rearrangement of peoples or political structures.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> If an entity were to be strongly biased toward positive societal
effects, what would this do to his yellow ray in the aura as opposed to an
entity who wanted to create an empire of society and govern it with an iron
fist?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. Let us take two such positively oriented active souls no longer
in your physical time/space. The one known as Albert went into a strange
and, to it, a barbaric society in order that it might heal. This entity was able
to mobilize great amounts of energy and what you call money. This entity
spent much green ray energy both as a healer and as a lover of your
instrument known as the organ. This entity’s yellow ray was bright and
crystallized by the efforts needed to procure the funds to promulgate its
efforts. However, the green and blue rays were of a toweringly brilliant
nature as well. The higher levels, as you may call them, being activated, the
lower, as you may call them, energy points remaining in a balance, being
quite, quite bright.
<p>
The other example is the entity, Martin. This entity dealt in a great degree
with rather negative orange ray and yellow ray vibratory patterns. However,
this entity was able to keep open the green ray energy and due to the
severity of its testing, if anything, this entity may be seen to have polarized
more towards the positive due to its fidelity to service to others in the face
of great catalyst.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Could you give me the last names of Albert and Martin?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. These entities are known to you as Albert Schweitzer and
Martin Luther King.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> I thought that that was correct, but I wasn’t sure. Can you give
me the same type of information that we have been getting here with
respect to the unmanifested interacting between self and gadgets and toys
and inventions?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. In this particular instance we again concentrate for the most
part in the orange and in the yellow energy centers. In a negative sense
many of the gadgets among your peoples, that is what you call your
communication devices and other distractions such as the less competitive
games, may be seen to have the distortion of keeping the mind/body/spirit
complex unactivated so that yellow and orange ray activity is much
weakened thus carefully decreasing the possibility of eventual green ray
activation.
<p>
Others of your gadgets may be seen to be tools whereby the entity explores
the capabilities of its physical or mental complexes and in some few cases,
the spiritual complex, thus activating the orange ray in what you call your
team sports and in other gadgets such as your modes of transport. These
may be seen to be ways of investigating the feelings of power; more
especially, power over others or a group power over another group of otherselves.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</b></i></big> What is the general overall effect of television on our society
with respect to this catalyst?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. Without ignoring the green ray attempts of many to
communicate via this medium such information of truth and beauty as may
be helpful, we must suggest that the sum effect of this gadget is that of
distraction and sleep.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Can you give me the same type of information that we are
working on now with respect to war and rumors of war?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. You may see this in relationship to your gadgets. This war and
self relationship is a fundamental perception of the maturing entity. There
is a great chance to accelerate in whatever direction is desired. One may
polarize negatively by assuming bellicose attitudes for whatever reason. One
may find oneself in the situation of war and polarize somewhat towards the
positive activating orange, yellow, and then green rays by heroic, if you may
call them this, actions taken to preserve the mind/body/spirit complexes of
other-selves.
<p>
Finally, one may polarize very strongly third ray by expressing the principle
of universal love at the total expense of any distortion towards involvement
in bellicose actions. In this way the entity may become a conscious being in
a very brief span of your <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>time/space</a>. This may be seen to be what you
would call a traumatic progression. It is to be noted that among your
entities a large percentage of all progression has as catalyst, trauma.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> You just used the term third ray in that statement. Was that
the term you meant to use?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</b></i></big> I am Ra. We intended the green ray. Our difficulty lies in our
perception of red ray and violet ray as fixed; thus the inner rays are those
which are varying and are to be observed as those indications of seniority in
the attempts to form an <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>harvest</a>.&#151;
<br><br><img src="http://tn3-2.deviantart.com/300W/i/0/f/8/Quantum_Dimensions_of_a_Human_2.jpg" border="0" hspace="12" vspace="12" align="left">
<br><i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> In previous communications you have spoken of the
<a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>mind/body/spirit complex totality</a>. Would you please give us a definition of
the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>mind/body/spirit complex totality</a>?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. There is a dimension in which time does not have sway. In
this dimension, the mind/body/spirit in its eternal dance of the present may
be seen in totality, and before the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>mind/body/spirit complex</a> which then
becomes a part of the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>social memory complex</a> is willingly absorbed into the
allness of the one Creator, the entity knows itself in its totality.
<p>
This <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>mind/body/spirit complex totality</a> functions as, shall we say, a resource
for what you perhaps would call the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>higher self</a>. The <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>higher self</a>, in turn, is a
resource for examining the distillations of <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>third-density</a> experience and
programming further experience. This is also true of <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>densities four, five, and
six</a> with the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>mind/body/spirit complex totality</a> coming into consciousness in
the course of <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>seventh density</a>.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Then would the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>mind/body/spirit complex totality</a> be
responsible for programming changes in catalyst during a <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>third-density</a>
experience of the mind/body/spirit complex so that the proper catalyst
would be added, shall we say, as conditions for the complex changed during
<a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>third-density</a> experience?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. This is incorrect. The <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>higher self</a>, as you call it, that is, that self
which exists with full understanding of the accumulation of experiences of
the entity, aids the entity in achieving healing of the experiences which have
not been learned properly and assists as you have indicated in further life
experience programming, as you may call it.
<p>
The <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>mind/body/spirit complex totality</a> is that which may be called upon by
the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>higher self</a> aspect just as the mind/body/spirit complex calls upon the
<a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>higher self</a>. In the one case you have a structured situation within the
<a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>space/time</a> continuum with the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>higher self</a> having available to it the totality
of experiences which have been collected by an entity and a very firm grasp
of the lessons to be learned in this density.
<p>
The <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>mind/body/spirit complex totality</a> is as the shifting sands and is in
some part a collection of parallel developments of the same entity. This
information is made available to the higher self aspect. This aspect may then
use these projected probability/possibility vortices in order to better aid in
what you would call future life programming.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Out of the Seth Material we have a statement in which Seth
says that each entity here on Earth is one part of or aspect of a <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>higher self</a> or
Oversoul which has many aspects or parts in many dimensions all of which
learn lessons which allow the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>higher self</a> to progress in a balanced manner.
Am I to understand from this that there are many experiences similar to the
one which we experience in the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>third-density</a> which are governed by a single
<a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>higher self</a>?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. The correctness of this statement is variable. The more in
balance an entity becomes, the less the possibility/probability vortices may
need to be explored in parallel experiences.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Do I understand from this then that the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>higher self</a> or
Oversoul may break down into numerous units if the experience is required
to what we would call simultaneously experience different types of catalysts
and then oversee these experiences?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. This is a statement we cannot say to be correct or incorrect
due to the confusions of what you call time. True simultaneity is available
only when all things are seen to be occurring at once. This overshadows the
concept of which you speak. The concept of various parts of the being
living experiences of varying natures simultaneously is not precisely accurate
due to your understanding that this would indicate that this was occurring
with true simultaneity. This is not the case.
<p>
The case is from universe to universe and parallel existences can then be
programmed by the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>higher self</a>, given the information available from the
<a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>mind/body/spirit complex totality</a> regarding the probability/possibility
vortices at any crux.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Could you give an example of how this programming by the
<a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>higher self</a> would then bring about education through parallel experiences?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. Perhaps the simplest example of this apparent simultaneity of
existence of two selves, which are in truth one self at the same <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>time/space</a>, is
this: the Oversoul, as you call it, or <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>higher self</a>, seems to exist simultaneously
with the mind/body/spirit complex which it aids. This is not actually
simultaneous, for the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>higher self</a> is moving to the mind/body/spirit complex
as needed from a position in development of the entity which would be
considered in the future of this entity.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Then the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>higher self</a> operates from the future as we understand
things. In other words my <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>higher self</a> would operate from what I consider to
be my future? Is this correct?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. From the standpoint of your <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>space/time</a>, this is correct.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> In that case my <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>higher self</a> would have a very large advantage in
knowing what was needed since it would know, as far as I am concerned,
what was going to happen. Is this correct?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. This is incorrect, in that this would be an abrogation of free
will. The <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>higher self</a> aspect is aware of the lessons learned through the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>sixth density</a>.
The progress rate is fairly well understood. The choices which must
be made to achieve the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>higher self</a> as it is are in the provenance of the
mind/body/spirit complex itself.
<p>
Thus the higher self is like the map in which the destination is known; the
roads are very well known, these roads being designed by <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>intelligent infinity</a>
working through <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>intelligent energy</a>. However, the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>higher self</a> aspect can
program only for the lessons and certain predisposing limitations if it
wishes. The remainder is completely the free choice of each entity. There is
the perfect balance between the known and the unknown.&#151;

<br><i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> If an entity polarizes toward the service-to-self path, would
anger have the same physical effect that it would have on the entity
polarizing on the service-to-others path? Would it also cause cancer, or is it
just a catalytic effect working in the positively polarizing entity?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. The catalytic mechanisms are dependent, not upon the chosen
polarity of a mind/body/spirit complex, but upon the use or purpose to
which this catalyst is put. Thus the entity which uses the experience of
anger to polarize consciously positively or negatively does not experience the
bodily catalyst but rather uses the catalyst in mental configuration.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> I am not sure that I understand that. Let’s take some examples:
an entity polarizing toward the negative path becomes angry. Let’s take the
condition where he develops a cancer. What is the principle that is at work
for him?
<p>
<i><b><big>RA:</big></b></i> I am Ra. We see the thrust of your query and will respond at variance
with the specific query if that meets with your approval.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Certainly.
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> The entity polarizing positively perceives the anger. This entity, if using
this catalyst mentally, blesses and loves this anger in itself. It then intensifies
this anger consciously in mind alone until the folly of this red-ray energy is
perceived not as folly in itself but as energy subject to spiritual entropy due
to the randomness of energy being used.
<p>
Positive orientation then provides the will and faith to continue this
mentally intense experience of letting the anger be understood, accepted,
and integrated with the mind/body/spirit complex. The other-self which is
the object of anger is thus transformed into an object of acceptance,
understanding, and accommodation, all being reintegrated using the great
energy which anger began.
<p>
The negatively oriented mind/body/spirit complex will use this anger in a
similarly conscious fashion, refusing to accept the undirected or random
energy of anger and instead, through will and faith, funneling this energy
into a practical means of venting the negative aspect of this emotion so as to
obtain control over other-self, or otherwise control the situation causing
anger.
<p>
Control is the key to negatively polarized use of catalyst. Acceptance is the
key to positively polarized use of catalyst. Between these polarities lies the
potential for this random and undirected energy creating a bodily complex
analog of what you call the cancerous growth of tissue.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Then as I understand it you are saying that if the positively
polarizing entity fails to accept the other-self or if the negatively polarizing
entity fails to control the other-self, either of these conditions will cause
cancer, possibly. Is this correct?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. This is partially correct. The first acceptance, or control
depending upon polarity, is of the self. Anger is one of many things to be
accepted and loved as a part of self or controlled as a part of self, if the
entity is to do work.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Then are you saying that if a negatively polarizing entity is
unable to control his own anger or unable to control himself in anger that
he may cause cancer? Is this correct?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. This is quite correct. The negative polarization contains a great
requirement for control and repression.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> A repression of what?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. Any mind complex distortion which you may call emotional
which is of itself disorganized, needs, in order to be useful to the negatively
oriented entity, to be repressed and then brought to the surface in an
organized use. Thus you may find for instance, negatively polarized entities
controlling and repressing such basic bodily complex needs as the sexual
desire in order that in the practice thereof the will may be used to enforce
itself upon the other-self with greater efficiency when the sexual behavior is
allowed.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Then the positively oriented entity, rather than attempting
repression of emotion, would balance the emotion as stated in an earlier
contact. Is this correct?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. This is correct and illustrates the path of unity.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Then cancer is a training catalyst operating for both polarities
in approximately the same way but creating or attempting to create
polarization in both directions, positive and negative, depending upon the
orientation of the entity experiencing the catalyst. Is this correct?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. This is incorrect in that catalyst is unconscious and does not
work with intelligence but rather is part of the, shall we say, mechanism of
learn/teaching set up by the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>sub-Logos</a> before the beginning of your
<a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>space/time</a>.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> How does cancer do this learn/teaching when the entity
developing cancer has no conscious idea of what is happening to him when
he develops cancer?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. In many cases catalyst is not used.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> What is the plan for use of the catalyst of cancer?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. The catalyst, and all catalyst, is designed to offer experience.
This experience in your density may be loved and accepted or it may be
controlled. These are the two paths. When neither path is chosen the
catalyst fails in its design and the entity proceeds until catalyst strikes it
which causes it to form a bias towards acceptance and love or separation and
control. There is no lack of <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>space/time</a> in which this catalyst may work.&#151;
<p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.llresearch.org/main.htm">http://www.llresearch.org/main.htm</a></div>
<br><br><br><img src="http://tn3-2.deviantart.com/fs6/300W/i/2005/077/9/a/Hook_by_Palawan.png" border="0" hspace="12" vspace="12" align="left">
<br><i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Why do you say the experience is drawn to or attracted to the
entity?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. We say this due to our understanding that this is the nature of
the phenomenon of experiential catalyst and its entry into the
mind/body/spirit complex’s awareness.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Could you give an example of how an entity sets up a
condition for attracting a particular experiential catalyst and how that
catalyst then is provided or is learned.
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. Such an example may be given.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Will you give that?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. We paused to scan (name’s) consciousness to use its
experiential catalyst as example. We may proceed.
<p>
This is one instance and extrapolation may be made to other entities which
are aware of the process of evolution. This entity chose, before incarnation,
the means whereby catalyst had great probability of being obtained. This
entity desired the process of expressing love and light without expecting any
return. This entity programmed also to endeavor to accomplish spiritual
work and to comfort itself with companionship in the doing of this work.
<p>
Agreements were made prior to incarnation; the first, with the so-called
parents and siblings of this entity. This provided the experiential catalyst for
the situation of offering radiance of being without expectation of return.
The second program involved agreements with several entities. These
agreements provided and will provide, in your time/space and space/time
continuum, opportunities for the experiential catalyst of work and
comradeship.
<p>
There are events which were part of a program for this entity only in that
they were possibility/probability vortices having to do with your societal
culture. These events include the nature of the living or standard of living,
the type of relationships entered into in your legal framework, and the social
climate during the incarnation. The incarnation was understood to be one
which would take place at <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>harvest</a>.
<p>
These givens, shall we say, apply to millions of your peoples. Those aware of
evolution and desirous in the very extreme of attaining the heart of love and
the radiance which gives understanding no matter what the lessons
programmed: they have to do with other-selves, not with events: they have
to do with giving, not receiving, for the lessons of love are of this nature
both for positive and negative. Those negatively harvestable will be found at
this time endeavoring to share their love of self.
<p>
There are those whose lessons are more random due to their present
inability to comprehend the nature and mechanism of the evolution of
mind, body, and spirit. Of these we may say that the process is guarded by
those who never cease their watchful expectation of being of service. There
is no entity without help, either through self-awareness of the unity of
creation or through guardians of the self which protect the less sophisticated
mind/body/spirit from any permanent separation from unity while the
lessons of your density continue.&#151;
<br><br><br><img src="http://tn3-2.deviantart.com/fs9/300W/i/2006/011/2/4/Holding_the_sun_by_aflami.jpg" border="0" hspace="22" vspace="22" align="right">
<br><i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Now, I would like to then consider the origin of catalyst.                             First we have the condition of mind/body/spirit complex which, as a function of the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>first
distortion</a>, has reached a condition of blockage or partial blockage of one or
more energy centers. I will assume that catalyst is necessary only if there is at
least partial blockage of one energy center. Is this correct?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. No.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Could you tell me why?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. While it is a primary priority to activate or unblock each
energy center, it is also a primary priority at that point to begin to refine the
balances between the energies so that each tone of the chord of total
vibratory being-ness resonates in clarity, tune, and harmony with each other
energy. This balancing, tuning, and harmonizing of the self is most central
to the more advanced or adept mind/body/spirit complex. Each energy may
be activated without the beauty that is possible through the disciplines and
appreciations of personal energies or what you might call the deeper
personality or soul identity.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Let me make an analogy that I have just thought of. A sevenstringed
musical instrument may be played by deflecting each string a full
deflection and releasing it producing notes. Instead of producing the notes
this way the individual creative personality could deflect each string the
proper amount in the proper sequence producing music. Is this correct?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. This is correct. In the balanced individual the energies lie
waiting for the hand of the Creator to pluck harmony.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> I would like then to trace the evolution of catalyst upon the
mind/body/spirit complexes and how it comes into use and is fully used to
create this tuning. I assume that the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>sub-Logos</a> that formed our tiny part of
the creation using the intelligence of the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>Logos</a> of which it is a part,
provides the base catalyst that will act upon mind/body complexes and
mind/body/spirit complexes before they have reached a state of
development where they can begin to program their own catalyst. Is this
correct?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. This is partially correct. The <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>sub-Logos</a> offers the catalyst at
the lower levels of energy, the first triad; these have to do with the survival
of the physical complex. The higher centers gain catalyst from the biases of
the mind/body/spirit complex itself in response to all random and directed
experiences.
<p>
Thus the less developed entity will perceive the catalyst about it in terms of
survival of the physical complex with the distortions which are preferred.
The more conscious entity being conscious of the catalytic process will
begin to transform the catalyst offered by the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>sub-Logos</a> into catalyst which
may act upon the higher energy nexi. Thus the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>sub-Logos</a> can offer only a
basic skeleton, shall we say, of catalyst. The muscles and flesh having to do
with the, shall we say, survival of wisdom, love, compassion, and service are
brought about by the action of the mind/body/spirit complex on basic
catalyst so as to create a more complex catalyst which may in turn be used
to form distortions within these higher energy centers.
<p>
The more advanced the entity, the more tenuous the connection between
the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>sub-Logos</a> and the perceived catalyst until, finally, all catalyst is chosen,
generated, and manufactured by the self, for the self.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Which entities incarnate at this time on this planet would be in
that category of manufacturing all of their catalyst?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. We find your query indeterminate but can respond that the
number of those which have mastered outer catalyst completely is quite
small.
<p>
Most of those harvestable at this <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>space/time</a> nexus have partial control over
the outer illusion and are using the outer catalyst to work upon some bias
which is not yet in balance.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> In the case of service-to-self polarization, what type of catalyst
would entities following this path program when they reach the level of
programming their own catalyst?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. The negatively oriented entity will program for maximal
separation from and control over all those things and conscious entities
which it perceives as being other than the self.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> A positively oriented entity may select a certain narrow path of
thinking and activities during an incarnation and program conditions that
would create physical pain if this were not followed. Is this correct?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. This is correct.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Would a negatively oriented entity do anything like this?
Could you give me an example?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. A negatively oriented individual mind/body/spirit complex
will ordinarily program for wealth, ease of existence, and the utmost
opportunity for power. Thus many negative entities burst with the physical
complex distortion you call health.
<p>
However, a negatively oriented entity may choose a painful condition in
order to improve the distortion toward the so-called negative emotive
mentations such as anger, hatred, and frustration. Such an entity may use
an entire incarnative experience honing a blunt edge of hatred or anger so
that it may polarize more towards the negative or separated pole.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Prior to incarnation, as an entity becomes more aware of the
process of evolution and has selected a path whether it be positive or
negative, at some point the entity becomes aware of what it wants to do
with respect to unblocking and balancing its energy centers. At that point it
is able to program for the life experience those catalytic experiences that will
aid it in its process of unblocking and balancing. Is that correct?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. That is correct.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> The purpose then, of what we call the incarnate physical state,
seems to be wholly or almost wholly that of experiencing the programmed
catalyst and then evolving as a function of that catalyst. Is that correct?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. We shall restate for clarity the purpose of incarnative existence
is evolution of mind, body, and spirit. In order to do this it is not strictly
necessary to have catalyst. However, without catalyst the desire to evolve
and the faith in the process do not normally manifest and thus evolution
occurs not. Therefore, catalyst is programmed and the program is designed
for the mind/body/spirit complex for its unique requirements. Thus it is
desirable that a mind/body/spirit complex be aware of and hearken to the
voice of its experiential catalyst, gleaning from it that which it incarnated to
glean.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Then it seems that those upon the positive path as opposed to
those on the negative path would have precisely the reciprocal objective in
the first three rays; red, orange, and yellow. Each path would be attempting
to utilize the rays in precisely the opposite manners. Is this correct?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. It is partially and even substantially correct. There is an energy
in each of the centers needed to keep the mind/body/spirit complex, which
is the vehicle for experience, in correct conformation and composition.
<p>
Both negative and positive entities do well to reserve this small portion of
each center for the maintenance of the integrity of the mind/body/spirit
complex. After this point, however, it is correct that the negative will use
the three lower centers for separation from and control over others by sexual
means, by personal assertion, and by action in your societies.
<p>
Contrary-wise, the positively oriented entity will be transmuting strong red-ray
sexual energy into green-ray energy transfers and radiation in blue and
indigo and will be similarly transmuting selfhood and place in society into
energy transfer situations in which the entity may merge with and serve
others and then, finally, radiate unto others without expecting any transfer
in return.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Can you describe the energy that enters these energy centers?
Can you describe its path from its origin, its form, and its effect? I don’t
know if this is possible.
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. This is partially possible.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Would you please do that?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> The origin of all energy is the action of free will upon love. The nature
of all energy is light. The means of its ingress into the mind/body/spirit
complex is duple.
<p>
Firstly, there is the inner light which is Polaris of the self, the guiding star.
This is the birthright and true nature of all entities. This energy dwells
within.
<p>
The second point of ingress is the polar opposite of the North Star, shall we
say, and may be seen, if you wish to use the physical body as an analog for
the magnetic field, as coming through the feet from the earth and through
the lower point of the spine. This point of ingress of the universal light
energy is undifferentiated until it begins its filtering process through the
energy centers. The requirements of each center and the efficiency with
which the individual has learned to tap into the inner light determine the
nature of the use made by the entity of these in-streamings.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Does experiential catalyst follow the same path? This may be a
dumb question.
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. This is not a pointless question, for catalyst and the
requirements or distortions of the energy centers are two concepts linked as
tightly as two strands of rope.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> You mentioned in an earlier session that the experiential
catalyst was first experienced by the south pole and appraised with respect
to its survival value. That’s why I asked the question. Would you expand on
this concept?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. We have addressed the filtering process by which in-coming
energies are pulled upwards according to the distortions of each energy
center and the strength of will or desire emanating from the awareness of
inner light. If we may be more specific, please query with specificity.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> I’ll make this statement which may be somewhat distorted and
then let you correct it. We have, coming through the feet and base of the
spine, the total energy that the mind/body/spirit complex will receive in the
way of what we call light. Each energy center then filters out and uses a
portion of this energy, red through violet. Is this correct?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. This is largely correct. The exceptions are as follows: The
energy ingress ends with indigo. The violet ray is a thermometer or
indicator of the whole.&#151;

<br><i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Could you give an example of how feelings affect portions 
of the body and the sensations of the body?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. It is nearly impossible to speak generally of these mechanisms,
for each entity of proper seniority has its own programming. Of the less
aware entities we may say that the connection will often seem random as the
<a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>higher self</a> continues producing catalyst until a bias occurs. In each
programmed individual the sensitivities are far more active and, as we have
said, that catalyst not used fully by the mind and spirit is given to the body.
<p>
Thus you may see in this entity the numbing of the arms and the hands
signifying this entity’s failure to surrender to the loss of control over the life.
Thus this drama is enacted in the physical distortion complex.
<p>
In the questioner we may see the desire not to be carrying the load it carries
given as physical manifestation of the soreness of those muscles for carrying
used. That which is truly needed to be carried is a preincarnative
responsibility which seems highly inconvenient.
<p>
In the case of the scribe we see a weariness and numbness of feelings
ensuing from lack of using catalyst designed to sensitize this entity to quite
significant influxes of unfamiliar distortion complexes of the mental,
emotional, and spiritual level. As the numbness removes itself from the
higher or more responsive complexes the bodily complex distortions will
vanish. This is true also of the other examples.
<p>
We would note at this time that the totally efficient use of catalyst upon
your plane is extremely rare.&#151;
<br><br><br><img src="http://tn3-1.deviantart.com/fs4/300W/i/2004/206/3/0/July_4th_Fireworks.jpg" border="0" hspace="22" vspace="22" align="right">
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> We would seem to have dual catalysts operating, and the
question is which one is going to act first. The prophecies, I will call them,
made by Edgar Cayce indicated many Earth changes and I am wondering
about the mechanics describing the future. Ra, it has been stated, is not a
part of time and yet we concern ourselves with possibility/probability
vortices. It is very difficult for me to understand how the mechanism of
prophecy operates. What is the value of such a prophesy such as Cayce
made with respect to Earth changes and all of these scenarios?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. Consider the shopper entering the store to purchase food with
which to furnish the table for the time period you call a week. Some stores
have some items, others a variant set of offerings. We speak of these
possibility/probability vortices when asked with the understanding that such
are as a can, jar, or portion of goods in your store.
<p>
It is unknown to us as we scan your <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>time/space</a> whether your peoples will
shop hither or yon. We can only name some of the items available for the
choosing. The, shall we say, record which the one you call Edgar read from
is useful in that same manner. There is less knowledge in this material of
other possibility/probability vortices and more attention paid to the
strongest vortex. We see the same vortex but also see many others. Edgar’s
material could be likened unto one hundred boxes of your cold cereal,
another vortex likened unto three, or six, or fifty of another product which
is eaten by your peoples for breakfast. That you will breakfast is close to
certain. The menu is your own choosing.
<p>
The value of prophecy must be realized to be only that of expressing
possibilities. Moreover, it must be, in our humble opinion, carefully taken
into consideration that any <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>time/space</a> viewing, whether by one of your
<a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>time/space</a> or by one such as we who view the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>time/space</a> from a dimension,
shall we say, exterior to it will have a quite difficult time expressing time
measurement values. Thus prophesy given in specific terms is more
interesting for the content or type of possibility predicted than for the
<a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>space/time</a> nexus of its supposed occurrence.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> So we have the distinct possibility of two different types of
catalyst creating an atmosphere of seeking that is greater than that which we
experience at present. There will be much confusion, especially in the
scenario of Earth changes simply because there have been many predictions
of these changes by many groups giving many and sundry reasons for the
changes. Can you comment on the effectiveness of this type of catalyst and
the rather wide pre-knowledge of the coming changes but also the wide
variation in explanation for these changes?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. Given the amount of strength of the possibility/probability
vortex which posits the expression by the planet itself of the difficult
birthing of the planetary self into <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>fourth-density</a>, it would be greatly
surprising were not many which have some access to <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>space/time</a> able to
perceive this vortex. The amount of this cold cereal in the grocery, to use
our previous analogy, is disproportionately large. Each which prophesies
does so from an unique level, position, or vibratory configuration. Thus
biases and distortions will accompany much prophecy.&#151;
<br><br><br><img src="http://ic3.deviantart.com/fs5/i/2004/279/b/5/States_of_Being_by_nickmandler.gif" border="0" hspace="12" vspace="12" align="left">
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Then as these final days of the cycle transpire if the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>harvest</a>
were to occur now, today, it would have a certain number harvested
positively and negatively and a certain number of repeaters. I am going to
assume that because of the catalyst that will be experienced between now
and the actual <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>harvesting</a> time these numbers of <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>harvestable</a> entities will
increase.
<p>
Generally speaking, not particularly with respect to this planet but with
respect to general experience in <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>harvesting</a>, how big an increase in
<a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>harvestable</a> entities can you logically assume will occur because of the
catalyst that occurs in the final period such as this one, or am I making a
mistake in assuming that other planets have added catalyst at the end of a
<a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>harvesting</a> period when they have a mixed <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>harvest</a>?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. In the event of mixed <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>harvest</a> there is nearly always
disharmony and, therefore, added catalyst in the form of your so-called
“Earth changes.” In this assumption you are correct.
<p>
It is the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>Confederation’s</a> desire to serve those who may indeed seek more
intensely because of this added catalyst. We do not choose to attempt to
project the success of added numbers to the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>harvest</a> for this would not be
appropriate. We are servants. If we are called, we shall serve with all our
strength. To count the numbers is without virtue.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Now the added catalyst at the end of the cycle is a function
specifically of the orientation of the consciousness that inhabits the planet.
The consciousness has provided the catalyst for itself in orienting its
thinking in the way it has oriented it, thus acting upon itself the same as
catalyst of bodily pain and disease act upon the single mind/body/spirit
complex. I made this analogy once before but reiterate it at this time to
clarify my own thinking in seeing the planetary entity as somewhat of a
single entity made up of billions of mind/body/spirit complexes. Is my
viewpoint correct?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. You are quite correct.&#151;
<br><br><br><br><img src="http://fc01.deviantart.com/fs5/f/2004/327/8/c/rebirth.gif" border="0" hspace="22" vspace="22" align="right">
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> This planet, to me, seems to be what I would call a cesspool of
distortions. This includes all diseases and malfunctions of the physical body
in general. It would seem to me that, on the average, this planet would be
very, very high on the list if we just took the overall amount of these
problems. Am I correct in this assumption?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. We will review previous material.
<p>
Catalyst is offered to the entity. If it is not used by the mind complex it will
then filter through to the body complex and manifest as some form of
physical distortion. The more efficient the use of catalyst, the less physical
distortion to be found.
<p>
There are, in the case of those you call <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>Wanderers</a>, not only a congenital
difficulty in dealing with the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>third-density</a> vibratory patterns but also a
recollection, however dim, that these distortions are not necessary or usual
in the home vibration.
<p>
We over-generalize as always, for there are many cases of preincarnative
decisions which result in physical or mental limitations and distortions, but
we feel that you are addressing the question of widespread distortions
towards misery of one form or another. Indeed, on some <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>third-density</a>
planetary spheres catalyst has been used more efficiently. In the case of your
planetary sphere there is much inefficient use of catalyst and, therefore,
much physical distortion.&#151;
<p>

<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> I would like, if possible, an example of the activity we call
Catalyst of the Mind in a particular individual undergoing this process.
Could Ra give an example of that?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. All that assaults your senses is catalyst. We, in speaking to this
support group through this instrument, offer catalyst. The configurations of
each in the group of body offer catalyst through comfort/discomfort. In fact
all that is unprocessed that has come before the notice of a mind/body/spirit
complex is catalyst.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Then presently we receive catalyst of the mind as we are aware
of Ra’s communication and we receive catalyst of the body as our bodies
sense all of the inputs to them, but could Ra then describe catalyst of the
spirit, and are we at this time receiving that catalyst and if not, could Ra
give an example of that?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. Catalyst being processed by the body is catalyst for the body.
Catalyst being processed by the mind is catalyst for the mind. Catalyst
being processed by the spirit is catalyst for the spirit. An individual
mind/body/spirit complex may use any catalyst which comes before its
notice, be it through the body and its senses or through mediation or
through any other more highly developed source, in its unique way to form
an experience unique to it, with its biases.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Would I be correct in saying that the archetype for the Catalyst
of the Mind is the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>Logos’s</a> model for its most efficient plan for the activity
or use of the catalyst of the mind?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. Yes.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> I was just wondering if the transparency of the garments on the
third (tarot) card indicates the semi-permeable nature of the veil between the
conscious and unconscious mind?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. This is a thoughtful perception and cannot be said to be
incorrect. However, the intended suggestion, in general, is an echo of our
earlier suggestion that the nature of catalyst is that of the unconscious; that
is, outward catalyst comes through the veil.
<p>
All that you perceive seems to be consciously perceived. This is not the
correct supposition. All that you perceive is perceived as catalyst
unconsciously. By the, shall we say, time that the mind begins its
appreciation of catalyst, that catalyst has been filtered through the veil and
in some cases much is veiled in the most apparently clear perception.&#151;
<br><br><br><img src="http://tn3-1.deviantart.com/fs6/300W/i/2005/059/f/1/Dimensions_of_a_Sunset_by_Artemia.jpg" border="0" hspace="22" vspace="22" align="right">
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> I see the present situation as the Creator knowing Itself by using the concept                          
of polarization. We seem to accentuate or to produce catalyst to increase the
desired polarization whether the desired mechanism be random, through
what we call the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>higher self</a>, or through utilizing the services of an
oppositely polarized entity acting upon us. All of these seem to produce the
same effect which is more intense polarization in the desired direction once
that direction has been definitely chosen. I see the catalyst of the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>second density</a>
insect bite being a function of either or any of the sources of which I
have spoken, from random to the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>higher self</a> or polarized services of
negative entities who monitor our activities, all of which have roughly the
same ultimate effect. Would Ra comment on my observation?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. We find your observations unexceptional and, in the large,
correct.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> In this particular case, which avenue was the one that produced
the catalyst of the bite?
<p>
<big><i><b>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. The nature of catalyst is such that there is only one source, for
the catalyst and experience are further attempts at specificity in dealing with
the architecture of the unconscious mind of the self. Therefore, in an
incarnational experience the self as Creator, especially the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>higher self</a>, is the
base from which catalyst stands to offer its service to the mind, body, or
spirit.
<p>
In the sense which we feel you intend, the source was the <a href='Law_of_One_CYCLOPEDIA.html'>fifth-density</a>,
negative friend which had noted the gradual falling away of the
inharmonious patterns of the distortion called anger/frustration in the
entity. The insect was easily led to an attack, and the physical vehicle, which
had long-standing allergies and sensitivities, was also easily led into the
mechanisms of the failure of the lymphatic function and the greatly
diminished ability of the immune system to remove from the yellow-ray
body that which distorted it.&#151;
<br><br><br><img src="http://tn3-1.deviantart.com/fs12/300W/i/2006/301/3/c/Between_Dimensions_by_CeramicsMaster.jpg" border="0" hspace="12" vspace="12" align="left">
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> The instrument asks the question why she lost her joy in the
recent past? Could Ra comment on that ?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. The instrument made a free will decision not to address the
physical catalyst causing great pain by means of the allopathically prescribed
chemical compound which the instrument was sure would be efficacious
due to its reliance upon the suggestions of Ra. Thus the catalyst was given
in a more complete form. The outer service to others became nearly
impossible, causing the entity to experience once again the choice of the
martyr; that is, to put value in a fatal action and die or to put value on
consciousness of the creation of the one Creator and, thereby, live.
<p>
The instrument, through will, chose the latter path. However, the mind and
mental/emotional distortions did not give the support to this decision
necessary to maintain the state of unity which this entity nominally
experiences and has experienced since its incarnation’s beginnings.
Since this catalyst has been accepted, the work begun to remove distortions
blocking indigo ray might well be continued apace.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Could Ra recommend work appropriate for removing indigo ray
blockage?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. We cannot recommend for the general situation for in each
case the distortional vortex is unique. In this particular nexus, the more
appropriate working is in the mental and mental/emotional powers of
analysis and observation. When the strongest and least distorted complex is
set in support, then the less strong portions of the complex shall be
strengthened. This entity has long worked with this catalyst. However, this
is the first occasion wherein the drugs to dull the pain that sharpens the
catalyst have been refused.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> Can Ra recommend anything that the instrument can do or
that we can do to improve any of the energies of the instrument?
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. This is previously covered material. We have outlined the path
the instrument may take in thought.
<p>
<i><b><big>Questioner:</big></b></i> I didn’t mean to cover previously covered material. I was
hoping to add to this anything that we could do to specifically focus on at
this time, the best possible thing that we or the instrument could do to
improve these energies, the salient activity.
<p>
<i><b><big>Ra:</big></b></i> I am Ra. Before responding we ask your vigilance during pain flares as
the channel is acceptable but is being distorted periodically by the severe
physical distortions of the yellow-ray chemical body of the instrument.
Those salient items for the support group are praise and thanksgiving in
harmony. These the group has accomplished with such a degree of
acceptability that we cavil not at the harmony of the group. As to the
instrument, the journey from worth in action to worth in esse is arduous.
<p>
The entity has denied itself in order to be free of that which it calls
addiction. This sort of martyrdom, and here we speak of the small but
symbolically great sacrifice of the clothing, causes the entity to frame a
selfhood in poorness which feeds unworthiness unless the poverty is seen to
be true richness. In other words, good works for the wrong reasons cause
confusion and distortion. We encourage the instrument to value itself and
to see that its true requirements are valued by the self. We suggest
contemplation of true richness of being.&#151;
