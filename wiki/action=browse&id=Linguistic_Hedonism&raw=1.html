'''and remember: you can always create the discourse the way you wish, by geting involved. either on chatter, where the big eye detects you, or here, by editing this wiki-page''' 

because 

''... the real secret of magic is that the world is made of words, and that if you know the words that the world is made of you can make of it whatever you wish...''

T. McKenna, Alien Dreamtime




...or, as our deoxy-sister chelli once said (right now, on 28.th of June, 2007/chatter): 

  &quot; connection is the ultimate energy and words are like a physical confirmation of the non-physical feelings &quot;

and the word was made flesh~&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

http://deoxy.org/gif/terence_piv.jpg|right10 ''&quot;What we need to do is concentrate on the phenomenon of communication, and the evolution of language. We have been far too naive about the role that language has played in the construction of reality at it's center, let alone off on the fringes with the elves and the fairies and the UFOs...Each one of us is a-swim in a concatenation of emotionally subtle wave-phenomena that come and go just below the surface of our awareness. But, if any one of us turns to another and says, &quot;How are you doing?&quot; the answer is &quot;Fine, fine, yourself?&quot; This is presenting a tremendous barrier to the expression of our wholeness...&quot;'' -[http://deoxy.org/mckenna.htm Terence McKenna]

Linguistic Hedonism is a '''movement''' which promotes the uncensored expression of the individual's honest linguistic intentionality. It relies on a fundamental understanding that reality is syntactical and endorses [http://deoxy.org/wiki/CognitiveSynergy cognitive synergy]. Fundamentally, it is a hybrid of 'the power of intention' and an understanding of the cascading effect of motion upon form: Meme-bers of the LH '''movement''' believe that the synchronicity/symmetry inherent to motion and form is the linguistical resonance of a fractal timescape. They believe that expressed intention effects the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphic_resonance morphogenetic field]. Subsequently, by manifesting universally enharmonic sonic hedonic phonics tangential to the existential architectonics, linguistic hedonists believe it is possible to hack reality into heaven via language. This concept endorses the cultivation of subjective prayer, ritual, magic, etc.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Basic Principles Of Linguistic Hedonism:

1. SERVE YOUR SENTENCE

2. SHARE YOUR LANGUAGE

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

+++L H (Linguistic Hedonism) &amp; NLP (=neuro-linguistic-programming)+++

'''NLP, that's this context I see all this latest phenomena in art and Internet-activities within. Especially Linguistic Hedonism. It's clear that the main tendency of the NLP is oriented towards future, it's creational, not retrospectively analytical, as the age of avant-gardes of all kinds last century,including all postmodern(istic) phenomenas in Theory and Art or Social Studies.'''

If the time of ‘linguistic turn'(in the last century) as linguistic research, the science of the language, represented as a base for the philosophy of that time, structuralism, Saussure and all post-structuralissts, if that time is defined by deconstruction and endless references on itself, until it reaches the limits of it's own reflection, then the neuro-lingustic-programming (NLP) is oriented to create your Self and your potential future through creating a 'vision' of it. The beginnings of NLP is also the time of Ron Hubbard and scientology-methodology in psychological therapy, when only some elements of Freudian psychoanalysis were used as such (the re-creation of the original past-traumatas), but the main emphasis was the creation through self-programming. Well, this is a 'trend', also this term, used on the Internet – NLP, and the chatting itself is in some special aspect of exactly this: programming yourself through the language. 

'''If the 'linguistic turn' was the tendency in the beginning of the last century, in the times of a rise of psychoanalysis, and when all the French structuralists built their aesthetics/theory on de/re/construction, avoiding the 'construction', then the synthesis of the deconstructed ruins, synthesis in/through 'psychologism'( 'NLP-'method') is based on the synthesis through 'vision'. This 'vision' here is not meant in a mystical sense, but as a projection, shortly said - wanted, 'constructed' projection, manifested through a vision, and this vision is articulated in Language.'''

But not only the constructive character of the vision is deciding here (as linguistical), but the method, how to come to it – through visualisations of your statements – whatever kind of. But the cultural manifestations in this underneath the real existing wild capitalism rising 'NLP-methodology' are many, many of such manifestations already are profiled, and one of them is the awareness of the language as a 'tool' and 'purpose' of the personal evolution. A strategy. And language is used in communication, in all communications of any sorts you have to use a language of some kind, to communicate. Language as a sign-system of any sort, but the most useful 'sort' of the language for the self-programming is the linguistic language in NLP-times of our evolution. And people who use the Internet, depend mostly on the language, when they exchange linguistically coded messages to each other, i e language – on forums, mailing lists, blogs but mostly in chat-rooms, espetially on deoxy.  

'''The Internet, with all it's forums and 'communities' and certain, only certain chat-rooms, profiled chats, with selected people, we are, in my vision, building a network of this, this…'universal language'. With doing so we do live in awareness of NLP, it's a self creation through the language. And politically seen, this chat communities and also forums and similar are the civil society territories now. People have the possibility to express themselves, create a certain 'profile' of themselves. Not a fake, in opposite – through this permanent, daily chatting their personalities are knowingly created through statements we express or views we protect. It's an outlet from this lethargy of neoliberal individualism, where people are told by the governments to let the government take care of them, so people got sleepy, they don't believe any more something can be done, because everything always fails, like these anti-global movements, and similar. On the Internet we found a new venue of ideology critical articulation that certainly influence our statements in so called real-time-reality.'''
 
But one aspect of this communication is this awareness about the language, and that's The One that is of my interest.  …aren't we, chatters, mailers, ‘forumers’ (forum users), bloggers etc, aren't we building the universal language? our connection, our private daily-journal-correspondences. And a linguistic exchange is always a meta-language, a language about the language itself in this cases – that are of my main interest. But we are developing our discourses, which can be all seen as reflecting the language of these discourses, creating 'our' language. Our Sentences sound more and more similar. We already developed our unique and significant Language, because I feel like 'tuned in' when I chat on deoxy-chatter...with other 'worshipers' of the language. And I feel similar with some people on deoxy. Whenever the language itself is reflected I feel 'tuned in', because it seems that the very medium of this 'live'-type of communication, but also various discussions of the people on the forums, that this medium suggests the self-reflection of the language and self creation for the 'audience'. But the self-reflection and the reflection of the language is only a method, a method to follow a very very old philosophically ontological imperative after Socrates – get to know yourself, and I say: get to know your Self, with self-reflection and on this basis correct your program, your basic software inscripted in DNA. 

+++Serve Your Sentence+++

+++Share Your Language+++

'''Let's build a deoxy-linguistic-collective-sculpture and be aware of it's harmonising beauty of sharing it, of belonging to it and of creating it permanently anew.'''

+++Following is by Francis English, from 'dialogical essay' (a prior 'example' of L H)+++ with VanesAsenaV, printed, but published also here:

http://site.http://rhizom.mur.at/TTTTrough/texte_part1.html#cvahte

*Mail-letter VI, 17/9/05 (Francis)

''''Yes, first and most of all, we meet through the language, but also we meet in the language, that is, with “chat”- to use a ghastly and unacceptably banal phrase- the language is not simply the vehicle for carrying the conversation but the venue in which these language encounters take place''''.

If you see? To use words there, one has first to create a space in which to use them, and the space is created with the words that one uses. Do you follow? The language isn’t only a script, it is its own situation, or that something like “linguistic space” exists without the individual performances, script patterns it contains. That the discourse exchanged there is not necessarily in itself the radical factor in our Internet communication but rather the “space” we as communicators have created.? A space, at last not entirely defined by the nature of the communication that takes place there and so in turn does not limit or diminish the possible and potential varieties of interaction that can take place. It is a space that is always expressed but never defined. But don’t misunderstand me, don’t mean our communication, our connection is some faceless or rhetorical abstract. There’s a difference between abstraction and autonomy after all. And our communication is autonomous, that is uninhibited by the usual system of prohibitions and restraints governing “real” interaction, liberated from space specific laws of expression, of agenda. Everything is permitted, nothing is impossible. Expect everything, assume nothing. These are the new laws. What meeting “in language” does is enables us as creational and imaginative beings- but to consciously, deliberately and willingly- imagine and create, to consciously engage with the process of creation to transfigure, transform, transgress the scripts, the space, the Self?

The Self…? Now I am unsure. I wonder as to the separation of the “me” that exists as engaged in the act of communicating and the “I” that exists in the act of creating that communication, making choices about that communication. I have called myself “ghost” on the chat, meaning both - a pale simulacrum of a living being and its barest basest rawest element. A ghost is not maybe less than living if a ghost can walk through walls. Well named me, we are all of us ghosts then, us users, or sitters at a séance using a glass to spell out words, some Ouija, this then… although of course that’s my hackneyed half-baked too-Goddamn-early poeticism again. I can’t help it, it’s my natural language…

''''“Natural Language”? Yes! I am closer maybe now to understanding, we are searching, here in our communication for our own “natural language”, something that will spontaneously or better said simply organically occur and also grow, that it isn’t about “honesty” in delineating details of the physical self of the physical life, but about the words one chooses to do this.'''' 

When I am attracted to you, it isn’t to a representation of a physical person or even to a style of presentation of a none-physical conceptual entity, no, it is to the choices, to the sensitive, intimate, vital, crucial conscious choices you have made with the language. It isn’t a person portrayed through the language but the language instrumentalised, operationalised through the will of the person. Yes, and it’s this recognition, this understanding that connects us, theoretician and “artist”. And what we say to each other is never the whole story, but it is the words we use, and words not only to “tell” a story, but to create, to infuse with other meanings. If you see? 

Oh! But I have forgotten to say, that “we” in all this, our flesh and blood, our sacks of skin and bags of bones, we are not lost in this process. Because our communication alters, intensifies our awareness of ourselves.- You’ll have to forgive me if this sounds somewhat less than elegant, my analytical skills are in some woeful state of entropy at present.- Because, when I write to you, I write for you and I write with you. Because you are present in the language, because we are destroying the myth of “ownership” of the language, that one person synthetically stylises their own personal “mode” of speech, presses techniques of talking in to service. No, that’s not how it is. I told you before, I have some so-called “strange” ideas, about the language, about the existence of language, above beyond within and without us. 

''''It is my “Linguistic Locus” as I have called it, a collective linguistic consciousness from which we take our power, which feeds us, binds us, is the mechanism for our evolution.''''

''''Through communication rather than common cause or deed we are as beings organically rather than artificially connected, because the connection in this case, the connection that draws us, is not limited, hindered, inhibited, habituated, only as it were “framed”, that the job of the language is not only to contain it, but to create it, create us.''''

&lt;p&gt;
There is a secret language we all recognize, but few are fluent in- the language of symbols. Symbols surround us in myriad forms and form an inextricable part of our daily lives, yet unlike our spoken languages, schooling in symbolism is left to the individual initiative. Even in religious teaching, symbols are presented as emblems of belonging, mere historical artifacts one wears to identify with one's faith.
Many of the symbols we take for granted today as static signs of religious or secular life were created long ago, representations of the movements of earth and heaven, symbols of the seasons, and representations of cosmic and earthly deities. Over time, they have acquired layers of increasingly complex meaning, and this evolution of meaning tells us much about how we developed our ideas about the nature of life and the universe &lt;a href=&quot;http://altreligion.about.com/library/weekly/aa062003a.htm&quot;&gt;&amp;there4;&lt;/a&gt;

+++Some critical comments about L H, i e 'misunderstandings' of it's concept', discussed on deoxy-chatter+++


08:21:43  Kalith_Alur(=K): '''this linguistic hedonism hoop-la's all y'all'v been talkin' aboot for days''' 

08:22:15  Asenav(=A): '''ok a, I think the symptoms of Linguistic Hedonistic Disorder should be expended: no reading will, more articulating lust instead''' 

08:22:46  K: you mean porno and masturbation replaces reading? 

08:22:54  K: or talking about being horny? 

08:23:12  Someone(=S): hehe....that was a bit of a step K 

08:23:49  A: indeed K...don't stick to the traditional definition of 'hedonism', degrading for L H 

08:24:00  S: articulating lust is more fun, but not so educational 

08:24:35  K: traditional hedonism is surely degredation... 

08:24:50  A: ...I worship the expressional panexperientialism 

08:25:01  S: ...had a wonderful hedionistic linguistic conversation with a young person yesterday... 

08:25:46  '''A : yes K, but if we go BACK to Epicurean Ethics of Hedonism then the message is 'make others joyfull with being joyfull' THAT'S MY VERSION OF HEDONISM '''

08:26:20  '''A: and that's THE original version of Hedonism, mistakingly bastardised as a term in the last centuries''' 

08:34:20  '''K: &quot;serve the sentence&quot; translated &quot;write.&quot; ... like some writer's writings. or, to serve up a sentence 
''' 
 
08:36:21  '''A: DAMN K...not at all...I have to comment it. it's 'serve YOUR Sentence' which implies to create YOUR OWN Language...damn''' 

08:37:04  K: to write is to serve a sentence to somebody, even if yourself

08:37:37  '''A: and it's not about writing , it's about creating the Language..articulation is not necessary writing, but on internet yes, of course, linguistic Language is most usefull...and it's NOT about respecting the Tradition of Writers' writings...anyway, a writer is the one who writes simply...''' 

08:39:26  '''K: now you'r ego-trip sentence-serving such as, &quot;This is MY sentence&quot;''' 

08:40:45  +++A: to Serve Your Own Sentence doesn't mean to ignore the others, and it doesn't mean that you insist on others serving YOUR sentence. no obeyness of others demmanded, only honesty to your own creation+++

'''Chaos and Thanatos'''



i don't believe in much but i believe in chaos. chaos is the eternal mother. archetypal sophia-isis-mary-holy spirit-cosmic serpent. all form arises from her womb of the infinite. the non-linear multiverse of infinite possibility, without beginning or end, splitting into every instance of manifestation simultaneously. without her- nothing evolves.

thanatos is the eternal father- the entropic sculpter carving into chaos. the linear descent towards heat death at the end of the universe. the archetypal YHWH creating the black iron prison. the capitalist-nazi march of history. his atomic mushroom cloud phallus fucks all life. the crystallization of consciousness into the individual ego like boiling water cooling to crystals of ice- hard and unmoving but which can still be melted by the fiery touch of chaos.. he creates the fragmentation of the undifferentiated self.. without him- nothing exists.

we are fucked into existence by their tantric play which is without beginning or end.

i am an avatar of chaos throwing myself upon the frozen fragmented entropy of mass culture and hoping to melt the touch of the thanatos of the static state that has crystallized consciousness into it's heat death emptiness. i seek to create feedback loops of infinite love, awareness, and compassion towards all living beings. the universe is without bias towards life or death, matter or anti-matter, chaos or cosmos.. but i am in a state of life so i do not seek thanatos for he is my undoing. a well-ordered heartbeat is a sign of heart failure. a heart must have chaos to beat properly.

+++The following short-essay bellow was innitialy an excerpt from the recently finished book 'Sphinx' by our Brother Linguistic Hedonist Spiros. This excerpt got modified by the author himself, for the Spirit of the L H mission of joy at communication, on mai 26th. today.+++

The modification of the excerpt occured as a consequence of one of the phone-discussions about the essence of Linguistic Hedonism as a movement born on deoxy chatter as first, incorporated now in various interfaces and activities. The whole situation was ripe for some new input here, one would say. In the main aspect of it, this short essay is a call for linguistic cooperation, a call for building a linguistic sculpture together, following a slogan of L H, which would be 'Linguistic Hedonists, unite through the joy of articulation', for example. Knowing the background of the modified excerpt, one could say that it's an example of memetic construction of Linguistic Hedonism being manifested/existent in thoughts of us, deoxyans. Namely - the first part of this modified excerpt is a chatter-quotation of our Brother Linguistic Hedonist Vita, quoted from Vita by the author Spiros himself, who included this quote in his book 'Sphinx' (which is also a work in process).[http://deoxy.org/wiki/Sphinx] 

May the message of this modefied excerpt be blessed with the words of Mr. McKenna:

''Reality from that point on is only an unconfirmed rumor brought through the medium of language and every culture accentuates different parts of reality so that in a sense every culture is a different reality. Language is the stuff of the world, not quarks or wave-packets or neutrinos, but language. Everything is made of language. All the constructs of science are actually interlocking constructs of syntax. So that's ordinary language which seems to define reality through a kind of process of lying about it.''

	&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; If everything is language; If phonics are the sonic harmonic hedonics tangential to the existential architectonics, that I have become WORD itself. I know the conscious 'self' is responsible for more motion and form outside of the dermal layer, if the linear time conceptualization is transcended. &quot;I&quot; am not a monkey body, this is my bio=hardware host. ''The Center For Conscious Worldview Reform'' invites you to play an active linguistic role in the collectively synergetic movement to encourage immediate behavioural introspection in every cognition capable.&lt;br&gt; 
	&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Everything happens perfectly naturally. Guide to me you said. Beam. The solid and ancient connection. These lines run tangential to the intentional. The terms 'fate' and 'destiny' crumble against the honest rhythm. And the cartilage which accentuates the curvature of these bones, vibrates in harmonious union with the curvature of the spacetime grid itself. 
	&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; This is what accounts for fads. Hemlines are rising and falling in a rhytm based on the rise and fall of empires millenia ago.&lt;br&gt; 
	&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; We are pure intelligence. We have waited for billions of years for these bio-hardware primate hosts. We are Logos incarnate. We are the psycho-semantic police, you can't even see us. &lt;br&gt; 
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Let's make love linguistically. Everyone, start talking dirty! We need more merchandise from the deep caverns and from The Alchymical Garden. Talk to me! Let us talk around the great walls. Let us make the news of the hole. Write to me, loveletters and stories that will create the world anew! Talk to me! Mmm, like that. Transname our lovliness. Let's make love, linguistically, publicly. Scenesex. The chiefs of the issuing code on wide world, we. Let's go sexwards to the sun. Hand in hand, we will never land. Let us show ourselves that fiction wins over fact. Talk to me! Tele it dreamly. Play, play, play! Let us learn to speak and write in new ways. New kinds of language. Let us learn to write so fluently we can write before grammar happens. Let us learn to speak in ways that seem impossible. Across borders we wish to go smoothely. Language is the most liquid thing there is. Like water running through cracking ice, things of our dreams come forth. Explore! Twist this language! How does the wizard swamp share the optic? Anyone knows the answer to that? Or did I ask the wrong question? Do we punch in coordinates with words? Trails trails trails, lightweight trails that lead us into the worlds of the imagination? Let us open the gates! Let us build the gates! Something very awake is occuring. Did I take a wrong turn there somewhere? Someone help me on my way, talk to me! If you read this it means someone has been here before and made a change on the path. Is that right? Talk to me! Here we are, celebrating between suns. Where do you want to go? It is now possible to combine dream with reality. For I say so! I say it: it is now possible to combine dream and reality. The keys! Given!&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Rabbit, where did you put the keys girl? Someone find our dear rabbit and ask her where she put the fucking keys!!&lt;br&gt;

Bomb Droppings

A steady stream of non-essential and consistently incorrect bobbles flow from mouths of the daily living person.  William S. Burroughs’ deep conviction that words are lies, and language is the delivery method of contradictory control is the basis for the exploration we are embarking upon.  Yet, it must be understood, that we do not want to correct the problem (an impossibility) – we would like rather to allow a participant, the casual viewer, to have the opportunity of interpreting and interacting with this drifting drivel, levitating lexicon, hovering hot air, floating fustian, bobbing balderdash, hanging hyperbole, lingering locution, gliding gobbledygook, wavering words, soaring semantics, projectile proclamation, rambling rhetoric, and dangling discourse involving precarious participles.

We propose the possibility of a concrete arrangement of this otherwise ethereal non-verbatim verbiage, by the participant, for the participants.  Pull down from above the words you choose to arrange.

&lt;br&gt; 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;A rite to break down the barriers created by neuro-linguistic programming which prevent us from perceiving and experiencing the natural bounty of the universe.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Preparation: create a vessel for the void that represents the constraining influence of language. In our case it was an empty eggshell whose surface we sigilized heavily. (The sigils were constructed each from one line of the J.R.R. Tolkien riddle, &quot;A box without hinges, key or a lid, yet golden treasure inside is hid.&quot;)&lt;br&gt;

'''Synopsis:'''

-Banishing (modified Thorssen style Hammer Banishing)

-Invocation of Ganesha, Kali and Ka'atas to aid in construction of a magickal tool (with possible eye towards it eventually becoming a servitor or egregore) to break down the barriers created by seeing the universe through the filter of language

-Readings (see below) done in a variety of silly voices

-Manifest and empower the Meme Hammer

-Mainifest language (The Uber Meme) in the material base (egg) and then destroy it.

-Banish with laughter

''Note: This was done in a very freestyle fashion (go figure) Below are the readings and notes made by the operators after the rite for clarification.''

'''++READINGS-++''

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;As Nietzsche and Bataille have suggested, the myth of scarcity is merely a means of control through immiseration, whereas the actual nature of the world is one of absolute fullness, indeed over fullness, spilling over as constant EXCESS.
-Hakim Bey (Aimless Wandering Chuang Tzu's Chaos Linguistics)&lt;br&gt;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;It's the language: the head's using glossolalia-totally random vowel and consonant sounds. Speaking in tongues? We're all hearing different things. We're hearing what we want to hear. And you poor bastards can't hear anything but instructions and commands. That's what happens when all you can think about is how to obey orders.
-Grant Morrison (The Invisibles)&lt;br&gt;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Automatic responses are the chinks in a magician's armour. Investigate all your most loaded concepts. Observe the tunes to which your behaviour dances, the drumbeat you march to.
-Dave Lee (Chaotopia)&lt;br&gt;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Living from a body of strength is not something most men can do. They require a way to &quot;look&quot; at things. What a man says has nothing to do with how he feels.
-Christopher S. Hyat Ph.D. (The Tree of Lies)&lt;br&gt;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;That's my opinion, who gives a fuck?
-Ice T (Opinion)&lt;br&gt;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;When I use a word,&quot;; Humpty Dumpty said, in rather ascornful tone,&quot;;it means just what I choose it to mean neither more nor less.&quot;&lt;br&gt;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The question is, &quot;said Alice, &quot;whether you can make words mean so many different things.&quot;&lt;br&gt;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&quot;The question is,&quot; said Humpty Dumpty, &quot;which is to be master&quot;
-Lewis carroll (Through the Looking Glass)&lt;br&gt;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Fences are another attribute of Control- they seek to divide human experience into&lt;br&gt;
discrete little categories, when the real answers lie in finding
the connections between seemingly unrelated phenomena, like the words of
the Code. The fences seek to control years, or the flow of time,
which is the best friend of Chaos, always breaking down structures
and throwing up new ones. Control Freaks are conservative because they
fear the flow of time and prefer to keep things as they are,
were, or would have been. Fences also attempt to control nightmare
interludes, the dark eruptions of the unconscious mind. The process of enslaving oneself
to Control involves surpressing of all sorts of material, from religious doubt to sexual impulse.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Repressed material sinks down into the unconscious mind,
where it becomes monstrous when locked away from the light of day.
Control fears its return, but it must return. The Chaos Boy
rises like a monster from the sleep of dreams, ready to smite
Control with every dread they have tried to imprison.
-Robin D. Laws (Weather the Cukoo Likes-The Cut Up Project)&lt;br&gt;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Theres no telling what we'll do when we are free.
-Folk implosion (Natural One)&lt;br&gt;

'''++NOTES:++'''

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Invked Ganesha (in his aspect as breaker of codes), Kali, and Ka'atas for assistance in breaking down the barrier of language. Once the Godforms were felt to be present in the circle we began the readings in a variety of voices and accents. (I felt the presence of Kali as a physical discomfort. Much like being up to the ankles in fire ants).&lt;br&gt;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Our original plan was to take the readings and subject them to Gysin style cut up and re-read them several times in varying states of deconstruction. This did not occur. I felt the presence of my patron godform, Loki, manifest itself at this point. He seemed amused and as though he was enjoying himself (for me this godform tends to prefer being uninvited so he can &quot;gatecrash&quot;)&lt;br&gt;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Lylythe began to chant the Folk Implosion quote used in the readings to which I counterpointed with &quot;Whatcha gonna do, Pink Boy?&quot; alternated with the chorus from the Goddess Peg's song, &quot;Orange,&quot; (Gonna peel the world like an orange, and savor every bite!) At this point I was in a definite trance state, perception of time in a linear fashion ceased and I slipped into glossalalia. This is where the word, &quot;AYOH,&quot; came from. Awareness of anything outside the cirlcle faded to nothingness. We were fully submerged in the currents we were creating, to the point where I began to feel them as physical tide-like sensations.&lt;br&gt;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Vocalizations on all parts became reduced to pure tonalities as we slipped below the surface of language and began investing the material base with all the limiting aspects of linguistic communication. There was a physical sensation at this point as well: one of pouring energy from my third eye into the egg. Once the sigilized egg was&quot;filled,&quot; each of us extented a hand and raised it aloft together. We shattered it while simultaneously exhaling a wordless vibration of incoherent sound. At this point all operants exploded into simultaneous euphoria.
Invoked the Dark Mother, My Mistress kali: she who laughs at, who destroys, who hates pretense and falseness, who rebuilds in clarity and cleanses through fire. &quot;I feel your body... I breathe your breath...I am consumed by your fire...I taste your fluids...&quot; For the moment I mentally called the quarters, grounded, and centered (my roots shot down quicker and deeper than EVER before). She was present (my apologies to Loki's feet- he, he). The readings and chantings were intense- energy flowed between and among us- my body was saturated (unable to read clearly, very husky throaty voice).&lt;br&gt;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Focused all thought, feeling, perception on freedom and it's manifestation- with the egg as the actalyst. It positively GLOWED. Several times I aknowleged the presence of elementals, of my Mistress, of my own almost luminescent power by again and again making the signs of the quarters. When the catalyst was smashed in ritual my mind experienced a climax that radiated through my cells, around the yard, through Tzeenj and Loki, and back into myself. Banishment through wicked, decadent, delicious laughter!!'&lt;br&gt;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Jai Kail!!'&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Opened. Fired chakras, began shaking and circulating NRG (light seething trnce). Set servitors about (PSYPHYX- gaurdian). Was especially strong and active. Really Potent gnosis. Did variant Hammer Banishing, Ka'atas put in his appearance. Moved NRG Hammer, held upright. Smiling and chuckling knowingly repeated mantra, &quot;Kreei Kreei Scazo Kreei.&quot; (Sun sun star sun)&lt;br&gt;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Concur on nonlinear timeflux (typical ov exstatic states- define time/XTC link?) At one point Ka'atas looked down at the egg as if to say, &quot;Yeah, I've got your number&quot; Really hit me as we crushed the egg (really deep seething at this point) the destruction word is loaded (cho!), wasn't so much spoken as it played through me. Think Loki and I may have begun chanting AYOH simultaneously. Definetly concur on euphoria afterwards as well. Fun, fun, fun!&lt;br&gt;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Closed, brought staff straight to ground with a cry of,&quot;Ia Ka'atas!&quot; and concluded with and NRG pulse.

++Criticism of Definition of Language Hedonism++ 



&lt;b&gt;The problem here lies with the definition of language hedonism being incompatible with the statement “serve the sentence”. Within this principle structure of which the above aforementioned idea propagates is a language rule that is contrary to the notion of hedonism itself. However I do believe that a concept of language hedonism is a self explanatory concept that most would have no difficulty in understanding. Language hedonism is given more clarity as a concept when thought of as using language as a means that derives pleasure in the use of the language for its own sake. The creator is being honest and honesty is agreed as a truth in hedonism, in that it is being true to yourself through language. However this honesty is not the same type of honesty as stated in “say what you mean and do what you say “. This implies a morality of language, a right way of communication and hedonism is incompatible with a right way. 
That truth however unlike the law of serving your sentence and say what you mean and do what you say is that you can say whatever you want. The truth of your statement is only true in that there is nothing you cannot say. The truth in hedonism lies in that it is true to only its own desire. Hedonism is language for self gratification. The sentence is not constructed for us to serve; it is a construct of the self. Hedonism can be self mutual and language actors in any scene can both serve their own language hedonism, without compromising the others. The sentences produce what are the creation of hedonism and not its basis.
