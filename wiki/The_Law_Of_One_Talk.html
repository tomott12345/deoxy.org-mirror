cyc's wiki has caught my interest...the law of one...I am hoping to keep up with his work on his wiki...
<p>
and as he progresses in his wiki...prehaps I too will progress to a new way of thinking...
<p>
I love it when my train of thought is bent...and I start to see and think in a new way...
<p>
thanks cyc...for your wiki...

If you don't want the page edited perhaps you could put it in your user page. The fact about wiki is the pages <i>can</i> be edited by any user. The actual substance of the article i.e. from below the heading 'The Law of One' I think is good, and I wouldn't edit that. I think it's a chance you have to take when using wiki that someone will edit it. You can always revert the page, or discuss changes on this page.

<p>
Thanks for your input merlyn. In fact the reason I put that introduction there was to go ahead and start experimenting with using Wiki until it could be put onto my user page. I was under the impression that had to be done by an admin etc. from something I had read elsewhere. I suppose I misunderstood the process. As all this is brand new to me, I am also not sure what "revert the page" means. Let me know what needs to be done in either case, so that I can then remove the beginning introduction section as I was planning to do once it is moved to my user section.
<p>
Thanks in advance for any help or suggestion you can give, Cyclopian.
<p>
<hr class=wikiline size=2>
<p>
I don't think anyone will edit the article &#151; it looks good as it is. What I was suggesting was that you 'cut to the chase' as it were. I'm suggesting you cut the first paragraph and make the introduction brief, so that readers are straight into the article.
<p>
I think leave the page as a standalone page. There is no need to meove it to your user page, and since this page 'The Law Of One' isn't about <i>you</i> it's probably better in the main body of the wiki.
<p>
Good work !

<u><b>UPDATE</u>: OK all, I <i>think</i> I have gotten the main page edited and more or less complete for now. There is definitely more material coming on other subject matters from the Law of One. The feedback and PM's I have recieved has been encouraging. However, I am not sure about how much "room" is left on the page. Besides that, I would not want to have that one page so insanely long that it is overbearing. When I have time to work on the other subjects, I will post the details here.</b>

Greetings stinky, 
<p>
Thanks for your interest and comments about my Wiki. Personally, the material "bent" my train of thought in countless ways, and thus my reason for creating the page. I can only hope it does the same for others in some form or another; or in the very least creates an avenue into questions and alternate ways of perceiving reality. I look forward to your thoughts about the various subjects presented.

[That is the work of wind and fire. The spiritual body energy field is a pathway, or channel. When body and mind are receptive and open, then the spirit can become a functioning shuttle or communicator from the entity’s individual energy/will upwards, and from the streamings of the creative fire and wind downwards.]
<p>
I have a question...is it possible for a person to channel...without knowing it...?...I only ask because of something that happened years ago...
<p>
stinky...
<hr class=wikiline size=2>
Greetings Stinky,
<p>
Having no reference personally, I can only go by what I have read and been told by those who have 'been there'. The answer would be yes, but it is a complicated set of circumstances both leading up to it and during its occurence. If it is something you are interested in exploring in more detail I would recommend reading 'A Channeling Handbook'; which is online for free <a href='http://www.llresearch.org/main.htm'>here</a>, in the 'Library' section of the site. It is the most thorough and honest book I have seen on the subject overall.
<p>
Adonai, Cyclopian
<hr class=wikiline size=2>
greetings cyc...
<p>
thanks for the tip on the channeling handbook...will certainly check it out...
<p>
I am reading your wiki bit by bit...and making sure to let things soak in, I have learnt that if something is hard to understand not to walk away from it...cause eventually it will all fall together...
<p>

<hr class=wikiline size=2>
<p>
hi cyc...
<p>
...[The disciplines of the mind involve, first of all, identifying both those things of which you approve and those things of which you disapprove within yourself, and then balancing each and every positive and negative charge with its equal. The mind contains all things. Therefore, you must discover this completeness within yourself.]...
<p>
does the above quote mean for example...if you constantly have a low opinion of yourself...that you also have a high opinion of yourself and are not aware of it...and if you polarize them by finding the one your not aware of...they become balanced...and then you too become balanced...?
<p>
stinky... 
<hr class=wikiline size=2>
<p>
Greetings stinky,
I believe what it means is that if you have, in the instance you gave, a <i>"constant low opnion of yourself"</i>, then the appropriate route would be: <i>"<u>an analysis of the sensation with especial respect to any unbalanced leaning between the love and the wisdom or the positive and the negative. Then whatever is lacking in the balanced sensation is, as in all balancing, allowed to come into the being after the sensation is remembered and recalled in such detail as to overwhelm the senses</u>"</i>.
<p>
So if I understand your question correctly, it is not so much that you <i>"...also have a high opinion of yourself and are not aware of it"</i>, as much as it means that you bring it about or create it consciously and with your Will, whether or not you were aware of it or not. If this is accomplished, then in a sense that particular catalyst, I believe, can in time approach a balance of sorts.
<p>
However, I do not think it means, overall, that you as a person will then be balanced because of this one catalyst being recognized and balanced out. Although, of course I must follow that up with the fact that on a certain level, you are indeed balanced and always have been; and that this is something to always keep in the forefront of your mind. One of the reasons for this is that: <i>"<u>the proper role of the entity is in this density to experience all things desired, to then analyze, understand, and accept these experiences, distilling from them the love/light within them. Nothing shall be overcome. That which is not needed falls away</u>"</i>.
<p>
And I believe this quote would apply here as well: <i>"<u>The key to balance may then be seen in the unstudied, spontaneous, and honest response of entities toward experiences, thus using experience to the utmost, then applying the balancing exercises and achieving the proper attitude for the most purified spectrum of energy center manifestation</u>"</i>
<p>
In other words, <i>"becoming balanced"</i> of course is the goal to strive for, but a goal that will most likely always be just out of reach, at least in this density. But the striving and dedication to such a goal is what slowly 'graduates' you to each successive level.
<p>
I hope this helped with some of the answers you were seeking,
<p>
Adonai, Cyclopian
<p>
<hr class=wikiline size=2>
<p>
yes..it has helped cyc...
<p>
[  The second area of learn/teaching is the study/understanding of the body complexes. It is necessary to know your body well. This is a matter of using the mind to examine how the feelings, the biases, what you would call the emotions, affect various portions of the body complex...]...
<p>
this is a good place to start for me...for individuals who abuse their body's...if one's body is not healthy due to emotions that lead to habits that create illness in the body...?...this would be the time to examine prehaps which emotions that keep one in an unhealthy lifestyle...harmful to the body...?
<p>
harmful emotions...creates an unbalanced and unhealthy body and mind...?
<p>
stinky...
<p>
<hr class=wikiline size=2>
<p>
are our thoughts the creators of our emotions...?...sometimes it feels like it always comes back to our thoughts...
