<h2>Terence McKenna Interview by OMNI Magazine, May 1993</h2>

"My life is like a James Joyce scratch pad," declares Terence
McKenna.  "I have a lot of fun, a kind of reverse paranoia.  I
think reality is a plot for my own amusement and advancement --
which it seems to be.  It's absolutely eerie."  Ethnobotanist,
radical historian, and co-steward of a botanical garden in Hawaii
where he collects endangered planet species and their lore,
McKenna is, as well, a world-class psychedelic researcher.
<p>
In the Sixties, it was not uncommon for friends or colleagues to
leave for awhile, then return.  These travelers, however, had not
made round trips to such identifiable exotic stops as Tibet or
China, or even Mexico.  Rather, they had tripped on acid or
mushrooms: new territory.  Upon reentry they would be asked the
usual questions one asks a traveler: "What did you see? Who did
you meet? How long were you gone?" And they'd show their slides,
as it were.
<p>
In those years, taking psychedelic drugs was viewed as self-
experimentation.  One's goal was informational -- to learn and
explore.  And taking drugs carried an unstated mandate: It was
incumbent upon you to contribute to the unofficial databank --
report the efficacy of varying settings, elapsed duration,
potential uses, and so forth.  It was not uncommon to ask, "Why
did you take it?" -- truly a statement of inquiry.  Terence
McKenna comes from this tradition.
<p>
Born in 1946 in western Colorado, McKenna moved to Los Altos,
California, when he was in high school.  He graduated from the
University of California at Berkeley with a major in shamanism
and the conservation of natural resources.  Collecting Asian art
in the East, for years he also made his living as a professional
butterfly collector.  In his 1992 book Food of the Gods, McKenna
delineates a radical history of drugs and human evolution,
chronicling our descent from "stoned apes" and extolling the
virtues of psilocybin mushrooms and DMT (dimethyltryptamine), a
potent psychedelic compound.  Eve achieves top billing in our
collective history as "the mistress of magical plants."
<p>
Heralded by some as the "New Scientist," McKenna admits that
"defenders of orthodox science find me a pain."  When he was
younger, this so bothered him that he sought the counsel of
Gunther Stent, the pioneering Swedish genetic biochemist. 
McKenna sat in front of his hero and earnestly laid out his
research, theories, and ideas of science.  "What I am interested
to know is," McKenna concluded, "are these ideas fallacious?" 
Rising from behind his desk, Stent crossed the room, placed his
hands on McKenna's shoulders, and delivered the following: "My
dear young friend, they aren't even fallacious!"  Although
crushed and shattered by the encounter, McKenna persevered to
become a high-voltage speaker, storehouse of remarkable
information, and prolific writer of worldwide repute.
<p>
Before this interview, McKenna offered friend and interrogator
Sukie Miller the following tip: "Being able to pun, sing, or
riddle will usually get you through fairy checkpoints.  To deal
with real fairies is to enter a realm of riddles and puzzle
settings where what they punish is stupidity and what they love
is intellectual cleverness."
<blockquote>
<b>OMNI:</b> You've been called a prophet, madman, the most important
visionary scholar in America, a bard of our psychedelic
birthright, and more.  How did you grow up?  Was there something
in the water at your house?
<p>
<b>MCKENNA:</b> I was born in a Colorado cattle and coal-mining town of
1,500 people called Paonia.  They wanted to name it Peony but
didn't know how to spell it.  In your last year of high school,
you got your girlfriend pregnant, married her, and went to work
in the coal mines.  An intellectual was someone who read Time. 
My mother went to secretarial school and had a very large
vocabulary.  She was aware of classical music and writing and was
my grandfather's favorite daughter.
<p>
His Metier was language.  He frequently used the phrase "the
fustilerian fizgigs from Zimmerman!"  I reconstructed it.  It
means "a shrewish fish-wife from a town named Zimmerman." 
Whenever he got excited, he'd yell, "'Great God!' said the
woodcock when the hawk struck him."  A nut, a poet is what he
was.
<p>
<b>OMNI:</b> How early in your life were you into altered states?
<p>
<b>MCKENNA:</b> Until I was three, we lived in my grandfather's house. 
I've had regression-hallucinations where I see myself in my child
body playing with my trains alone in that living room.  Then
something catches my attention and I turn and look: A DMT
hallucination is pouring out of the air, into this house, into
the room.  This is not supposed to be happening.  This is not
permitted!  It was as if an invisible teapot were beginning to
pour some heavy, colored liquid swimming with objects and shapes,
a flowering geometry.  It was as if reality got broken, like a
window could get broken, and the outside -- poured through the
teapot -- came rushing in.  I go to find my mother to show her. 
Then, of course, it's not there.
<p>
<b>OMNI:</b> And now? Toward what end is your research directed?
<p>
<b>MCKENNA:</b> I can't stomach the human tragedy of somebody going to
the grave ignorant of what is possible.  I make the analogy to
sex.  Few people can avoid some kind of experience with sex --
sex informs the experience of humanness; sex is a great joy and
travail.  I don't like to think about someone going to the grave
without ever having contacted it.  This work is that big.  It's
ours.  It makes available an entire domain of being that somehow
got lost, to our detriment.
<p>
<b>OMNI:</b> What is DMT's effect?
<p>
<b>MCKENNA:</b> My best guess is that it mediates attention so that when
you hear a noise coming from someplace within your peripheral
vision, you turn and focus on what the noise might be.  Somehow
this very rapid focusing of mental functioning is driven by DMT. 
It is also a Schedule I drug.  So technically, we are all
bustible all the time!  The paradox is that DMT is the safest and
quickest hallucinogen to leave your system -- safest, that is, in
terms of any accumulated detriment to the organism.
<p>
<b>OMNI:</b> Food of the Gods relates DMT to psilocybin.  What's the
connection?
<p>
<b>MCKENNA:</b> Psilocybin and DMT are chemically near relatives.  My
book is about the history of drugs; it tries to show drugs'
cultural and personality-shaping impact.  People have attempted -
- unsuccessfully -- to answer the question of how our minds and
consciousness evolved from the ape.  They've tried all kinds of
things to account for this evolution, but to my mind, the key
unlocking this great mystery is the presence of psychoactive
plants in the diet of early man.
<p>
<b>OMNI:</b> What led you to this startling conclusion?
<p>
<b>MCKENNA:</b> Orthodox evolutionary theory tells us that small
adaptive advantages eventually become genetically scripted into a
species.  The species builds upon this minute change to further
its adaptive advantage until ultimately it out breeds all of its
competitors for a particular niche or environment.
<p>
<b>OMNI:</b> So prehistoric humans got a leg up on the apes by ingesting
a drug?
<p>
<b>MCKENNA:</b> Yes.  Lab work shows that psilocybin eaten in amounts so
small that it can't be detected, as an experience, increases
visual acuity.  In the Sixties, Roland Fisher at the National
Institute of Mental Health gave graduate students psilocybin and
then a battery of eye tests.  His results indicated that edges
were visually detected more readily if a bit of psilocybin was
present in the student's body.  Well, edge detection is exactly
what hunting animals in the grassland environments use to observe
distant prey!  So here you have this chemical factor; when added
to the diet, it results in greater success in hunting.  That, in
turn, results in greater success in child rearing and so
increases the size of the next generation.
<p>
As we descended from the trees and into the grasslands, began to
experiment with bipedal gait and omnivorous diet, we encountered
mushrooms.  At low does, they increase visual acuity; at
midrange, they cause general central-nervous system arousal,
which in a highly sexed primate means a lot of horsing around,
which means there is more pregnancy among females associated with
psilocybin-using behavior.  Higher dosages of psilocybin leads to
group sexuality and dissolved boundaries between ecstasy.  We can
assume that as the level of ingestion became high enough, egoless
states were quite common.
<p>
The way I analyze the modern predicament -- pollution, male
dominance, there are a million ways to say it -- the overriding
problems are brought on by the existence of the ego, a
maladaptive behavioral complex in the psyche that gets going like
a tumor.  If it's not treated -- if there's not pharmacological
intervention -- it becomes the dominant constellation of the
personality.
<p>
<b>OMNI:</b> How did all this play out?
<p>
<b>MCKENNA:</b> From 75,000 to about 15,000 years ago, there was a kind
of human paradise on Earth.  People danced, sang, had poetry,
jokes, riddles, intrigue, and weapons, but they didn't possess
the notion of ego as we've allowed it to crystallize in Western
societies.  The reason for this lack of ego was a social style of
mushroom taking and an orgiastic sexual style that was probably
lunar in its timing.  Nobody went more than three or four weeks
before they were redissolved into pure feeling and boundary
dissolution.  Community, loyalty, altruism, self-sacrifice -- all
these values that we take to be the basis of humanness -- arose
at the time in a situation in which the ego was absent.
<p>
<b>OMNI:</b> If this was all so wonderful, why did it end?
<p>
<b>MCKENNA:</b> The most elegant explanation is that the very force that
created the original breakthrough swept away its conditions.  The
climatological drying of Africa forced us out of the forest
canopy, onto the grasslands, and into bipedalism and omnivorous
diets.  We lived in that paradisiacal grasslands situation, but
the climate was slowly getting drier.  Mushrooms began to be less
available.  There could've been many strategies for obtaining
mushrooms, all detrimental.  The first would be to do it only at
great holidays, and only a certain class of people -- shamans,
for example.
<p>
Eventually the mushroom only existed around water holes in the
rain shadows of certain mountains; finally, the mushroom was
gone.  At that moment, under great pressure from the drying
climate, agriculture was invented.  Agriculture represents an
intellectual understanding of how cause and effect can be
separated in time.  You return to last year's camp, look where
you discarded the trash, and there all in one place are the food
planets you so carefully gathered.  Women, the gatherers, put
this together: Wow!  Bury food, come back a year later, and it's
there.  This was a watershed in the development of abstract
thought.
<p>
At the same time, men were understanding that the sex act,
previously associated with this group orgiastic stuff, was the
equivalent of burying food and coming back a year later!  Male
paternity is recognized as a phenomenon.  The road to hell is
paved -- eight lanes! -- from that point on.  The man thinks my -
- my children, not our children -- and therefore, animals I kill
are food for my woman and my children.  Woman are seen as
property.  The ego is rampant and in full force.
<p>
<b>OMNI:</b> How does data on psilocybin support your theory?
<p>
<b>MCKENNA:</b> Well, here's the problem: Psilocybin, discovered in
1953, not chemically characterized until 1957, became illegal in
1966.  The window of opportunity to study this drug in humans was
only nine years.  People working with psilocybin never dreamed
they'd be forbidden by law to work in this area.  When LSD was
first released into the psychotherapeutic community, it swept
through the physics community.  People thought, "Ah-ha! Now we're
going to understand mental illness, trauma, and obsession, this
being only the first of a family of drugs that will lead to an
operational understanding of the genesis and curing of neuroses!"
<p>
When the scientific establishment was informed that there would
be no government-grant support for psychedelic research, they
just bowed their fuzzy heads and went along with it.  The
consequences of their failure to stand up to that decision is a
mangled society and a science that hasn't fulfilled it's agenda. 
In no other instance has science laid down so gutlessly and
allowed the state to tell it how to do its business.
<p>
I'm not trying to make a revolution in primate archaeology or
theories of human emergence.  My scenario, if true, has enormous
implications.  For 10,000 years, with the language and social
skills of angels, we've pursued an agenda of beasts and demons. 
Human beings created an altruistic communal society; then, by
withdrawing the psilocybin or having it become unavailable, we've
had nothing to fall back upon except old primate behaviors, all
tooth-and-claw dominance.
<p>
<b>OMNI:</b> You're giving an enormous amount of power to a drug.  What
can you tell me about psilocybin?
<p>
<b>MCKENNA:</b> We don't know what DMT means.  It's like Columbus
sighting land, and somebody says, "So you saw land; is that a big
deal?"  And Columbus says, "You don't understand; it is the New
World."
<p>
For the last 500 years, Western culture has suppressed the idea
of disembodied intelligences -- of the presence and reality of
spirit.  Thirty seconds into the DMT flash, and that's a dead
issue.  The drug shows us that culture is an artifact.  You can
be a New York psychotherapist or a Yoruba shaman, but these are
just provisional realities you're committed to out of
conventional or local customs.
<p>
<b>OMNI:</b> Well, it gives one something to do, Terence.
<p>
<b>MCKENNA:</b> Yes, but most people think it's what's happening. 
Psilocybin shows you everything you know is wrong.  The world is
not a single, one-dimensional, forward-moving, causal, connected
thing, but some kind of interdimensional nexus.
<p>
<b>OMNI:</b> If everything I know is wrong, then what?
<p>
<b>MCKENNA:</b> You have to reconstruct.  It's immediately a tremendous
permission for the imagination.  I don't have to follow Sartre,
Jesus, or anybody else.  Everything melts away, and you say,
"It's just me, my mind, and Mother Nature."  this drug shows us
that what's waiting on the other side is a terrifyingly real
self-consistent modality, a world that stays constant every time
you visit it.
<p>
<b>OMNI:</b> What is waiting? Who?
<p>
<b>MCKENNA:</b> You burst into a space.  Somehow, you can tell it's
underground or an immense weight is above it.  There's a feeling
of enclosure, yet the space itself is open, warm, comfortable,
upholstered in some very sensual material.  Entities there are
completely formed.  There's no ambiguity about the fact that
these entities are there.
<p>
<b>OMNI:</b> What are they like, Terence?
<p>
<b>MCKENNA:</b> Trying to describe them isn't easy.  On one level I call
them self-transforming machine elves; half machine, half elf. 
They are also like self-dribbling jeweled basketballs, about half
that volume, and they move very quickly and change.  And they
are, somehow, awaiting.  When you burst into this space, there's
a cheer!  Pink Floyd has a song, "The Gnomes Have Learned a New
Way to Say Hooray."  Then they come forward and tell you, "Do not
give way to amazement.  Do not abandon yourself."  You're
amazingly astonished.  The most conservative explanation for
these elves, since these things are speaking English and are
intelligent, is that they're some kind of human beings.  They're
obviously not like you and me, so they're either the prenatal or
postmortal phase of human existence, or maybe both, if you follow
Indian thinking.  You're saying, "Heart beat? Normal. Pulse?
Normal."  But your mind is saying, "No, no. I must be dead.  It's
too radical, too fucking radical.  It's not the drug; drugs don't
do stuff like this."  Meanwhile, what you're seeing is not going
away.
<p>
<b>OMNI:</b> What are these elves, these creatures about?
<p>
<b>MCKENNA:</b> They are teaching something.  Theirs is a higher
dimensional language that condenses as a visible syntax.  For us,
syntax is the structure of meaning; meaning is something heard or
felt.  In this world, syntax is something you see.  There, the
boundless meanings of language cause it to overflow the normal
audio channels and enter the visual channels.  They come
bouncing, hopping toward you, and then it's like -- all this is
metaphor; they don't have arms -- it's as though they reach into
their intestines and offer you something.  They offer you an
object so beautiful, so intricately wrought, so something else
that cannot be said in English, that just gazing on this thing,
you realize such an object is impossible.  The best comparison is
Faberge eggs.
<p>
The object generates other objects, and it's all happening in a
scene of wild merriment and confusion.
<p>
Ordinarily language creates a system of conventional meanings
based on pathways determinate by experience.  DMT drops you into
a place where the stress is on a transcending language.  Language
is a tool for communication, but it fails at its own game because
it's context-dependent.  Everything is a system of referential
metaphors.  We say, "The skyline of New York is like the
Himalayas, the Himalayas are like the stock market's recent
performance, and that's like my moods" -- a set of interlocking
metaphors.
<p>
We have either foreground or background, either object or being. 
If something doesn't fall into these categories, we go into a
kind of loop of cognitive dissonance.  If you get something from
outside the metaphorical system, it doesn't compute.  That's why
we need astonishment.  Astonishment is the reaction of the body
to the ineffectiveness of its descriptive machinery.  You project
your description, and it keeps coming back.  Rejected. 
Astonishment breaks the loop.
<p>
<b>OMNI:</b> What other experiences can you liken to the DMT trip?
<p>
<b>MCKENNA:</b> The archetype of DMT is the three-ring circus.  The
circus is all bright lights, ladies in spangled costumes, and
wild animals.  But right underneath, it's some fairly dark
expression of Eros and freaks and unrootedness and mystery.  DMT
is the quintessence of that archetype.  The drug is trying to
tell us the true nature of the game.  Reality is a theatrical
illusion.  So you want to find your way to the impresario who
produces this and then discuss his next picture with him.
<p>
<b>OMNI:</b> So the circus is really just a doorway.  How does it end?
<p>
<b>MCKENNA:</b> This crazy stuff goes on for 90 seconds; then you fall
away from it.  They bid you farewell.  In one case, they said to
me: "Deja vu, deja vu!"
<p>
<b>OMNI:</b> You've devoted a good part of your life to mapping the DMT
and psilocybin terrain.  How would you interpret all of it?
<p>
<b>MCKENNA:</b> These drugs can dissolve in a single lightning stroke
all our provisional programming.  The drugs carry you back to the
truth of the organism that language, conditioning, and behavior
are entirely designed to mask.  Once on the substance, you are
reborn outside the envelope of culture and of language.  You
literally come naked into this new domain.
<p>
<b>OMNI:</b> What do you say to doubters?
<p>
<b>MCKENNA:</b> DMT is utterly defeating of the drug-phobia.  We could
get rid of all drugs but DMT and psilocybin and have thrown out
nothing.  The fact that DMT is so brief and intense makes it look
as if it's designed for doubters.  Someone will say, "I can't
risk five hours on a drug.  It's nuts."  The unspoken thing
they're saying is, "My career, my life, will be ruined, so keep
it away from me."  But if you say to these people, "Look, you're
making these statements about drugs.  Can you invest ten minutes?
. . ."
<p>
DMT is inhaled.  The entire trip last that long with no after-
feelings.  They, fools that they are, with a naive version of
linear time, think, "Well, ten minutes, How bad can that be? 
Then you have them.  If they won't join after that, they'll at
least shut up.
<p>
<b>OMNI:</b> Do you think there is such a thing as a bad trip?
<p>
<b>MCKENNA:</b> A trip that causes you to learn faster than you want is
what most people call a bad trip.  Most people try to hold back
on the learning inherent in drugs.  But sometimes the drug
releases the information and says, "Here's what you need to
know."  The information may be, "You treat people wrong!" and
nobody wants to hear that or, "You have some habits you need to
think seriously about," and who wants to do that?
<p>
<b>OMNI:</b> How can you advocate drugs so strongly when such pain,
disruption, and chaos may be associated with taking them?
<p>
<b>MCKENNA:</b> We should talking about the word ecstasy.  In our world,
ruled by Madison Avenue, ecstasy has come to mean the
way you feel when you buy a Mercedes and can afford it.  This is
not the real meaning.  Ecstasy is a complex emotion containing
elements of you, fear, terror, triumph, surrender, and empathy. 
What has replaced our prehistoric understanding of this complex
of ecstasy now is the word comfort, a tremendously bloodless
notion.  Drugs are not comfortable, and anyone who thinks they
are comfortable or even escapist should not toy with drugs unless
they're willing to get their noses rubbed in their own stuff.
<p>
<b>OMNI:</b> What people specifically should not take them?
<p>
<b>MCKENNA:</b> People who are mentally unstable, under enormous
pressure, or operating equipment that the lives of hundreds of
people depend on.  Or the fragile ones among us -- those
to whom you wouldn't give a weekend airline ticket to Paris,
those you wouldn't expect to guide you out of the Yukon.  Some
people have been so damaged by life that boundary dissolution is
not helpful to them.  These people are trying to maintain
boundaries, their functionality.  They should be honored and
supported and not encouraged to take drugs.  If because of
genetic or cultural or psychological factors it's not for you,
then it's not for you.
<p>
We're not asking everybody to feel that they must take drugs, but
rather, just as a woman should be free to control her body, for
heaven's sake, a person should also be free to control his or her
mind.  Everyone should be free to do it and be well informed of
the option.  Drug information isn't that much different from sex
information.  We make a gesture toward sex education in schools. 
And we've come a long way.  We no longer make adulterers stitch
large letters on the fronts of their clothing.  But the issues of
drugs are more complicated because there's a vast spectrum, from
aspirin to heroin, and each has to be evaluated on its own
strengths and weaknesses.
<p>
<b>OMNI:</b> Would you want education of the joys of drugs in high
schools?
<p>
<b>MCKENNA:</b> Absolutely, because these kids are already self-
educating and informing each other through an underground body of
unsanctioned, scientifically unexamined knowledge.  We stand with
the issues of drugs where we were with sex in the Twenties and
Thirties.  You learn by rumor.  So people have funny ideas,
knowing far more about crack than they know about mescaline or
psilocybin.
<p>
Animal life has been transfused with something either willfully
descended into matter or trapped by some cosmic drama.  Something
in an unseen dimension is acting as an attractor for our forward
movement in understanding.
<p>
<b>OMNI:</b> Attractor?
<p>
<b>MCKENNA:</b> It's a point in the future that affects us in the
present.  For example, if you were to do your Christmas shopping
in July, then Christmas is an attractor for your summer shopping
habits.  Our model that everything is pushed by the past into the
future, by the necessity of causality, is wrong.  There are
actual attractors ahead of us in time -- like the gravitational
field of a planet.  Once you fall under an attractor's influence,
your trajectory is diverted.
<p>
<b>OMNI:</b> Does the attractor have a kind of intelligence?
<p>
<b>MCKENNA:</b> I think so.  It's what we have naively built our
religion around: God, totem.  It's an extradimensional source of
immense caring and reflection for the human enterprise.
<p>
<b>OMNI:</b> How will science explore the after-death state?
<p>
<b>MCKENNA:</b> By sending enough people into this other dimension to
satisfy themselves that this is eternity.  Here the analogy of
the New World holds: A few lost sailors and shipwreck victims
like myself are coming back, saying, "There was no edge of the
world.  There was this other thing.  Not death and dissolution,
not sea monsters and catastrophe, but valleys, rivers, cities of
gold, highways."  It will be a hard thing to swallow, but then
the scientists can go back to doing science on after-death
states.  They don't have to throw out their method.
<p>
<b>OMNI:</b> Where is your hope?
<p>
<b>MCKENNA:</b> With psychology and young people.  They have what we
never had: older people who went through a psychedelic phase. 
I'm meeting old freaks in Berlin, London, who are mentoring this
thing and trying to keep it away from what we perceive as our
mistakes, mainly political confrontationalism.  LSD was a direct
frontal assault on society.  An inspirited undergraduate in
biochemistry with his roommate's $20,000 trust fund can turn out
5 to 10 million hits of this drug in a long weekend.  This
immediately created pyramids of criminal activity of such size
and potential earning power that the government reacted as though
a gun had been pointed at its head.  Which it had.  The proper
strategy is stealth, subversion, and boring from within.
<p>
<b>OMNI:</b> Terence, my friend, does anything scare you?
<p>
<b>MCKENNA:</b> Madness.  People always ask, "Will I die on drug A, B, 
or C?"  That's the wrong question.  Of course you can die, but
what is at risk is your sanity, because it seems as though the
deconstruction of reality has no bottom, and you can just move
out into these places.  I worry about not being able to
contextualize these things, losing the thread allowing me to
return to the human community.  We're trying to build bridges
here, not just sail off.
<p>
<b>OMNI:</b> How do you see the future?
<p>
<b>MCKENNA:</b> If history goes off endlessly into the future, it will
be about scarcity, preservation of privilege, forced control of
populations, the ever-more-sophisticated use of ideology to
enchain and delude people.  We are at the breakpoint.  It's like
when a woman comes to term.  At a certain point, if the child is
not severed from the mother and launched into its own separate
existence, toxemia will set in and create a huge medical crisis.
<p>
The mushrooms said clearly, "When a species prepares to depart
for the stars, the planet will be shaken to its core."  All
evolution has pushed for this moment, and there is no going back. 
What lies ahead is a dimension of such freedom and transcendence,
that once in place, the idea of returning to the womb will be
preposterous.  We will live in the imagination.  We will quickly
become unrecognizable to our former selves because we're now
defined by our limitations: the laws of gravity; the need to eat,
excrete, and make money.  We have the will to expand infinitely
into pleasure, caring, attention, and connectedness.  If nothing
more -- and it's a lot more -- it's permission to hope.

<h2>What Is <a href="dmt.htm">DMT</a>?</h2>

Dimethyltryptamine is chemically related to the LSD, psilocybin
class of hallucinogenic drugs.  It is a serotonin agonist; that
is, it mimics the neurotransmitter serotonin, but interferes with
its normal action.  This class of drugs enhances the brain's
sensitivity to many kinds of incoming information.  As an
agonist, DMT locks into receptors of neurons usually available to
serotonin and competes with -- often "winning out" over --
serotonin at the receptor site.  To find out more about DMT's
mechanism of action, we consulted leading neurobiologist
and serotonin investigator, Dr. George Aghajanian of the Yale
University School of Medicine.
<p>
<b>AGHAJANIAN:</b> I'm finding that except for the fact that is has a
very short duration of action -- 30 to 45 minutes -- DMT has the
same effects on various receptors, particularly the serotonin-2
(5-HT2) receptor, as the other hallucinogens -- LSD or
mescaline -- that can have effects for up to eight hours.
<p>
<b><b>OMNI:</b></b> Is 5-HT2 a postsynaptic receptor?
<p>
<b>AGHAJANIAN:</b> Yes.  DMT also works on a presynaptic receptor, but
that is not the action responsible for its hallucinogenic
effects.
<p>
<b><b>OMNI:</b></b> Since DMT binds at these receptors, does that mean it is
found naturally in the brain?
<p>
<b>AGHAJANIAN:</b> Enzymes able to synthesize DMT exist in certain
tissues, such as in the lungs.  But there's no evidence that more
than a trace of DMT exists in the body, not enough to have any
pharmacological effect.
<p>
<b><b>OMNI:</b></b> What's the difference between DMT and LSD, psilocybin and
so forth?
<p>
<b>AGHAJANIAN:</b> All the other psychedelic hallucinogens I've looked
at in tissue -- brain slices -- have a remarkable prolonged
effect.  So it's interesting that in the same preparation, DMT
has a short-lived effect corresponding to its brief action
clinically.
<p>
<b><b>OMNI:</b></b> Why do the other psychedelics have more prolonged effects?
<p>
<b>AGHAJANIAN:</b> I think the other hallucinogens are taken up in lipid
[fat] compartments of the brain, cell membranes, and elsewhere
and that the drug is released slowly from these compartments. 
The persistence of effects depends on the continued presence of
the drug.  DMT is not very lipid soluble, so it's not stored in
the lipid compartments and thus washes out rapidly.
