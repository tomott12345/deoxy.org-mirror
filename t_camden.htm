<h1>The Camden Centre Talk <font size="-1">15/6/92</font><br><font size="-1">by <a href="mckenna.htm">Terence McKenna</a></font></h1>

Well, it's a pleasure to be here. I want to thank Evolution Records for, 
once again, making an event like this possible. It's always a pleasure to 
return to England. Let me see if I can get my act here and make an event 
of it. 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I thought I would talk about tonight, since I figure we did our homework
during my last visit, is how the psychedelic experience which we have as
individuals relates to the global future that we can feel the world being swept
toward and how this relates to our planetary paths. I think we can make some
sense out of the human condition if we're willing to look at psychedelic plants
not as simply tools for individual spiritual transformation, but actually as
tools and forces which transformed us as a species in the distant past, and I'll
just give it to you very briefly.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you may or may not know, all primates -- and we certainly are primates --
have what are called 'male dominance hierarchies'. This means that the
longest-fanged, meanest s.o.b. in a monkey tribe takes control of the group
resources, the females, the weaker males, and this character runs the show, and
this is pretty much how we do it today. But my belief, based on 25 years of
working with and taking psychedelic plants and substances, has led me to -- well,
certainly to the brink of hubris -- to make an adjustment to evolutionary theory
and suggest that these psychedelic substances are not private, peripheral,
ancillary, cultish, esoteric, meaningless, self-indulgent, narcissistic, or
obscure; they are in fact central to understanding how what we call 'human-ness'
actually came to be in the first place. I really believe that the reason we have
language and notions like community, altruism, loyalty, brotherhood, hope -- the
reason we have these qualities, which are the qualities that we embrace as most
human and most ennobling to us, is because for a period of roughly a hundred
thousand years we self-medicated ourselves and suppressed the poisonous presence
of the calcareous tumour of ego. <a href="egofalse.htm">Ego</a> is the psychological structure which is
propelling us to hell in a handbasket. The problems which beset the modern world
and which continue to go unaddressed and unresolved can all be traced to ego, to
our inability to emotionally connect with the consequences of what we are doing
to ourselves, to each other, to the world. Our newspapers are filled with data on
dissolving ozone holes, planktonic life in the ocean is endangered, toxic wastes
are accumulating -- you all know the litany. But in trying to trace it to a root
problem, I see it as ego -- the inability of the individual to get with the
programme of group values. And I believe that we have this problem because we
have fallen into an historical and cultural style that suppresses, denies and
ignores the powerful potential of psychedelic plants to transform personalities,
to erase boundaries, and to fuse people into a single thinking organism. This is
what the nomadic tribalism of the past was all about.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, how is this done, or how can this be? If you've had a psychedelic
experience, you know that each one is incredibly unique, addressed to the
individual, and seemingly as private a matter as one could possibly conceive. But
when, as a clinician or a person in my position, you have an opportunity to
listen to accounts of dozens, hundreds, of psychedelic experiences, you begin to
see the general outline of what these things are doing. And my analysis of it is
they dissolve boundaries, they erase differences, they introduce you to the
notion that reality is, in the wonderful phrase of Gregory Bateson, 'A seamless
web', that we are not atomic entities forever imprisoned in our own private
Idahos, we are in fact part of some kind of field. It's almost as though what the
psychedelics are attempting to do for sociology and psychology is what was
achieved by quantum physics from matter in the 1920s and '30s. Matter, during
that period, was re-analyzed and found to be not tiny hard billiard ball-like
particles whizzing through space carrying spin and electric charge, but that
there was another level, a lower layer, and that other level, that other
description, revealed an interactive wave system where individual points of
concrescence are merely statistical rather than real, everything dissolves into a
kind of soup of multi-leveled, multi-dimensional connectedness, and this is what
the psychedelic experience is. I believe that one way of thinking about life is
-- biology I mean -- is that it is a chemical strategy for amplifying quantum
mechanical indeterminism to such a degree that freedom, true freedom, shimmers
into existence at the macrophysical level -- the level that we, as thinking,
suffering, striving, dreaming organisms, actually occupy, and that the
amplification of quantum mechanical indeterminacy that allows for freedom then
allows evolutionary processes to reflect the forces which are impinging upon
them. 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, orthodox science hands you a universe that is characterised by a
forward-flowing casuistry where every event is somehow dependent in its
existential completeness upon the moment which came immediately before it. And I
believe that we can extract, as it were, from the psychedelic experience and
return with an entirely different notion of time, space and causality. Probably
most of you are familiar from your mathematics classes in school with the idea
that they teach you in trigonometry that all possible ellipses can be obtained by
sectioning a cone and we can build up a picture of a cone by examining thousands
and thousands of elliptical sections of that cone and then reasoning backward to
the higher-dimensional object which that cone represents. Well, I believe that
every psychedelic journey is a sectioning of a higher-dimensional object of some
sort, and that we ourselves, in our individual lives, also represent a sectioning
of this higher-dimensional object.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, then, the intellectual quest, the spiritual quest, becomes one of
empowering the felt presence of experience, both psychedelic experience and the
normal day-to-day experience of living, and noticing that that is the primary
stuff of which reality is made. Reality is not make of quarks and mu-mesons and
z-particles. Reality is made of language. Whatever we think reality is, it is an
entirely private matter until we describe it -- either linguistically,
mathematically, through painting, through dance, through innuendo -- whatever it
is, reality then undergoes the formality of actually occurring when it is
languaged, and what I've noticed about these psychedelics is that they are
catalysts for language. They are, as it were, an enzyme operating in the human
body politic propelling us to what's called 'stretch the envelope', stretch the
design perimeters of the human experience.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I don't think that many people actually realise how literally I take and
intend what I'm saying. I encountered the language issue on psychedelics about 22
years ago when one evening a friend of mine stopped by and he had a little vial
of an orange substance and he said 'would you like to try something new?' And I
had done my <a href="l_acid.htm">LSD</a> graduate work some few months before, and I only asked him one
question, I said 'How long does it last?' And he said 'It lasts about 10
minutes', and I said, 'Well, bring it on then my friend!' This was
dimethyltryptamine, <a href="dmt.htm">DMT</a>, and I smoked it and I saw -- I had a feeling of slight
anesthesia in my body -- I saw a swirling, floral mandala form behind my closed
eyelids, and as I moved toward this mandala, I realised I was going to penetrate
beyond it, and I burst through into a kind of other dimensional superspace, and
my... I had expected a kind of instant psychoanalysis or perhaps swirling colours
or moving geometric plains of light, perhaps a dancing canary or a little candies
doing two-steps in a row -- this is what's called hypnogochia in the medical
literature, and it is essentially trivial hallucination. Instead, what happened
was there was an encounter with what can only be described as an elf hive, a
colony of self-transforming, hyperdimensional machine creatures that came
bounding forward with joyful squeaks to dribble themselves like self-transforming
jeweled basketballs on the floor in front of me, and I was dumbstruck with
amazement. Occasionally people ask me 'Is DMT dangerous?', and I think the honest
answer is 'only if you fear death by astonishment'. Well, I was astonished, -- I
mean, I was an intellectual of the Hegel/Camus crowd when I went through that
violet scintillating doorway, and I came out a true believer. Because these
creatures in this place are filled with a kind of zany, affectionate, reckless
humour and a desire to communicate with human beings, or at least with me in that
moment. And what they were doing and how they were communicating was by
generating, through their songs, <em>objects</em>, so that what I was surrounded
by was a crowd of diminutive, self-transforming blobs of intentionalised
ectoplasmic material, and they were producing out of their bodies objects which
looked like Faberge eggs or exquisitely-tooled machines made of ivory, glass, and
gemstone that were themselves undergoing some kind of transformation, emitting
musical sounds, condensing liquid metal out of the air and causing it to rain
down on us. Well, my reaction to this was to go into a kind of shock of amazement
and, you know, it raises fairly profound questions, like number one, 'Surely I
must be dead, surely no-one can have this experience and return intact'. I mean,
because, you see, it exceeds imagining, it is beyond your imagining -- even when
you're looking at it, you attempt to pour the salutary waters of description over
these transdimensional objects and it runs, language runs off them like water off
a duck's back. And the emotional content of this kind of encounter is
tremendously intense.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things are attempting to communicate a new dispensation of the Logos. They are holding out the possibility that language need not be processed by the
ears, that language can become, under certain radical situations of neurological
perturbation, visible, that literally the word condenses into visible space, and
they were urging me to do this. They were urging me to experiment with my voice
and I discovered years later, taking Ayahuasca in the Amazon jungles, tribes of
Indians that have actually mastered this art, and that saturate their bodies with
DMT and harmaline, and then sing. But for them this singing is not a musical
exercise, it's a pictorial exercise. They see what they intend. This is a kind of
telepathy.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it's humbling, it's transformative, it's astonishing to realise that <a href="shaover.htm">shamans</a> all over the world for time uncountable have been accessing this
appalling, complex, ontologically challenging, scientifically impossible,
reality. This means that culturally we are living out some kind of schizophrenic
delusion, because we live our lives totally ignorant of these possibilities, or
perhaps only glimpsing them at the edge of anesthesia, or something like that,
unless, of course, we have the courage to be counter-cultural heads. But even
then many people confine themselves in the private world of their own reflection
because social pressure and, indeed, social legislation make it very touchy to
talk about these things. But I say to you, this is part of the human birthright.
This is as much a part of the game as birth, sex and dying. 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it may well be that there are kiliachasms(?) of time and that each
individual is reincarnated time after time after time, but I prefer to suppose
not, and to entertain the idea that this life represents an enormous and
improbable opportunity that is to be used for something, and the something that
it is to be used for is to go out to the edge and explore. You know, you can stay
within the conjured circle of scientific rationalism and ho-hum, mundane,
secular, yuppiehood, but the method that worked for me was to adore, pursue and
obsess on the bizarre, the peculiar, the <i>outre</i>. Somewhere there's an
alchemical text which says 'The highest mountains, the widest deserts, the oldest
books, there you will find the stone', and what I would like to suggest to you is
that of all the methods, tools, points of view, ideologies, and so forth that you
will meet when you begin your catalogue of the edge material, the psychedelic
dimension is the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of that dimension. Most spiritual seeking
is done with the accelerator pressed to the floor. Once you encounter
psychedelics you have found the answer. Now the name of the game changes. No
longer the ever-eager ingenue hanging on the guru's latest iron whim. Now you
have to face the answer. It's not a matter of blithely seeking, it's a matter of
screwing your courage to the sticking point, because the tool has been placed
into your hand that will work, that will deliver the goods. You know, people tend
to complain there's no adventure left in the world, the world is devoid of
challenge. I say to you 'five grams in silent darkness in the confine of your own
apartment on a rainy Sunday evening an you'll feel that Ferdinand Magellan should
take a back seat'.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We tend, you see, to always imagine the challenge rests with someone else. We
have been made spectators to life by a disempowering view of ourselves carried to
us by science and mass media. You know, you're supposed to identify with Madonna
or Elvis or somebody, but the richness -- the inner richness -- of one's own
being, because it cannot be bought and sold, is deemed worthless by the culture.
We actually live in a de-humanising culture and, as you know, the consequences of
a couple of thousand years of this kind of alienation are that now we face the
potential death of the planet. We have invented a sin for which there isn't even
a word in English that I am aware of, it's the sin of stealing the future from
your own children.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How, then, faced with a mounting panoply of facts, studies and statements that
point to imminent collapse of our ecosystem, our atmosphere and our social
support system, how can we change our minds? If hortatory preaching could do it,
then the Sermon on the Mount would have been the turning point. If horrifying
displays of military stupidity could have done it, then Hiroshima would have been
the turning point. We have to pharmacologically intervene. This is not a test.
This is not a game. We do not have 500 years, we do not have a hundred years, we
must awaken, and jolly quick, or evolution and planetary dynamics will write
"<i>finis</i>" to our fragile effort to build a transcendent vehicle that would
move us away from, you know, the mute present of the animal mind and into the
realm of spirit, poetry, art, love and transcendence. The only thing that I am
aware of that can work quickly enough to make this change are psychedelic
substances. They are the only things I've ever seen turn somebody a hundred per
cent around in the space of about five hours. On a global scale, this is the kind
of remedy that we are seeking. Well, why then can we simply not apply it? The
answer is that our problem arises out of our pathological commitment to ego, and
ego is what is put at risk by psychedelic compounds. I believe <a href="leary.htm">Tim Leary</a> once
said -- although he denies it, but it's so brilliant it's worth repeating -- that
LSD is a substance which occasionally causes psychotic behaviour in people who
have not taken it. This is the problem we're dealing with. These psychedelic
substances cause hysterical psychoses in people who have not taken them, and how
then do you talk them down out of their tree and attempt to convince them that
this is all well and good? Well, it isn't easy. It isn't going to come from the
upper echelons of the establishment, this revolution in thinking, it's going to
come from youth, it's going to come from people who stand outside the system and
can see its contradictions. 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, is it simply a political evolution, revolution, a desire for more
freedom, less entanglement with bureaucracy and restriction of civil rights? I
don't think so. I think that when we analyze carefully the content of the
psychedelic experience we have to leave our previous models behind. The
psychedelic experience is far more than instant psychotherapy or instant
regression to infantile traumatic situations, far more than simply a kind of
super-aphrodisiac, far more than simply an aid in formulating ideas or coming up
with artistic concepts. What the psychedelic experience really is, is opening the
doorway into a lost continent of the human mind, a continent that we have almost
lost all connection to, and the nature of this lost world of the human mind is
that it is a Gaian entelechy. It turns out, if we can trust the evidence of the
psychedelic experience, that we are not the only intelligent life forms on this
planet, that we share this planet with some kind of conscious mind -- call it
Gaia, call it Zeta Reticulians who came here a million years ago, call it God
Almighty, it doesn't matter what you call it, the fact of the matter is that the
claims of religion that there is some kind of higher power can be experientially
verified through psychedelics. Now this is not, in Milton's wonderful phrase 'The
God who hung the stars like lamps in heaven' -- it doesn't have to do with that,
in my opinion -- it isn't cosmic in scale, it's planetary in scale. There is some
kind of disincarnate intelligence. It's in the water, it's in the ground, it's in
the vegetation, it's in the atmosphere we breath, and our unhappiness, our
discomfort, arises from the fact that we have fallen into history and history is
a state of benighted ignorance concerning the real facts of how the world works. 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see, minded human beings existed for a hundred thousand years before what
we call history. I believe that in the Saharan plains of Africa, through the use
of psilocybin mushrooms -- at first unconsciously and then with conscious intent
-- boundaries were erased. The previous several million years of primate
hierarchy and male dominance were chemically medicated out of existence and men
and women lived in relationships of respect and balance with each other, with
their children, with the earth, with other human groups, and that this is the
memory of paradise that accounts for our deep nostalgia for the past. It isn't a
psychological mirage, it's real, there was a great mystery and it was lost, and
we are the impoverished children who have inherited this situation of loss and
abandonment, because you see the very forces which created the mushroom paradise
in the grasslands of Africa, that same force which was the climatological drying
out of the African continent and much of the rest of the planet, eventually
turned those grasslands to desert and at that point, under nutritional pressure
and with mushrooms a fading memory, agriculture was invented, paternity -- male
paternity -- was discovered. And once male paternity is discovered there is
tremendous anxiety on the part of males to control the behaviour of females and,
as you know, this is not easy, and so consequently social discord arises. You
see, what happened was for perhaps as long as two hundred thousand years, the
presence of psilocybin in the diet and the environment suppressed ego and so a
human relationship to the earth and to other people was possible, and during that
time religion, altruism, sense of community, loyalty, all these things I
mentioned, came to be. When the mushroom faded, those suppressed atavistic animal
behaviours returned, men became territorial, women became property, children
became chattel, and the unifying mushroom celebrations and the great lunar
orgiastic ceremonies that accompanied the worship of the Goddess -- that all was
suppressed and we marched off into history, a nightmare journey, that carries us
to today.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so you see, I see this whole business of the twentieth century as having
the psychedelic experience as its centrepiece, as a cultural icon, but
surrounding that are all the other impulses to the archaic that surround us now.
It begins as far back as impressionism, which deconstructs the realistic image of
the romantics, and then you get Freud's discovery of the unconscious, he points
out that we are not victorian ladies and gentlemen but dark thoughts split behind
our eyelids, that we are obsessed with sexuality, with fecal matter -- you know
the list. Following Freud comes Jung, who carries it a step further, introduces
the notion of a race mind, racial consciousness, archetypes. Working in a
slightly different area, people like Picasso journey to Africa and return to
Paris with the masks of tribal peoples which then begin to feed into the theories
of analytical and synthetic cubism. Simultaneously, the quantum physicists are
announcing that the orderly billiard ball world of the Hamiltonian atom has to be
replaced with wave mechanical functions of excruciating complexity, then you get,
you know, in short order, I don't know, abstract expressionism, rock and roll,
the outbreak of communal lifestyles of the 1960s -- you see, I think all of these
cultural phenomena can be placed under the umbrella of what I call 'an archaic
revival'. This is what house music is, this is what the psychedelic rebirth is,
this is what the new cyber-tribalism is, and at the centre of this the sparkplug,
the necessary element, the <i>sine qua non</i>, if you will, is the psychedelic
experience, because it's not an ideology, it's not something that you get from
Baba if you clean up around the ashram for a few years, it doesn't come to you
from some beady-eyed roshi, rishi, geshe, or guru. It's a direct relationship
between you and the plant, between you and nature, and when you open yourself up
to this you discover that this is the secret that was lost and how they keep the
lid on this I really haven't the faintest idea.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the biggest news around. I mean, if flying saucers were to land on the
front lawn of Buckingham Palace tomorrow, it would be less interesting than your
next DMT trip -- to you -- because the DMT trip happens to <em>you</em>. The
other, the <i>Guardian</i> or the <i>Economist</i> conveys it to us, and I
suppose most of us imagine this is how the news of transformation will arrive. I
don't think so. It's not going to come over the tele, it's going to come up from
the toes, out of the earth, through your groin, into your heart and up to your
brain. This is where the empowerment comes from, and until we begin to
decondition ourselves from the images that we are obtaining from the dominator
culture we will always be its creatures and it keeps us in a state of infantile
delusion. I mean, we are not playing with a full deck unless we integrate into
our psychology the presence of the psychedelic experience. Is it terrifying? You
bet it's terrifying. Will it change your life forever? You bet, you'll never be
the same. The analogy I like to make is to sexuality because the idea of someone
going from birth to the grave without ever having a psychedelic experience is to
me a notion that makes me as edgy as the idea of someone going from the birth to
the grave without ever having a sexual experience. It means you never really
rolled up your sleeves and played in the game. You were a spectator, you were a
silent witness, you slid through, and you then did not empower yourself to act to
reclaim the historical process, because the reclamation of the historical process
comes through a commitment to a return to the atavistic through the direct
transformation of experience, you see. This is not an ideology, there is no
dogma, there are no rules, this is not a menu of moral prescription, this is
something that happens between you and this transcendental reality. 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I believe that what shamans, including modern cyber-shamans, see when
they ascend to the psychedelic heights is actually the viewpoint that we would
have if we could penetrate into another dimension -- and I use the word in the
mathematically formal sense. You know, Plato said 'Time is the moving image of
eternity'. Well, I believe that what the shaman sees is the End, and that this
gives the shaman a tremendous self-confidence, a tremendous existential validity,
so that he or she can then return and take their place among the rest of us and
be a source of inspiration, of a transcendent exemplar.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, what is the nature of this End which is seen? Well, mmm, this is where
we part company with orthodoxy, if you think we hadn't already -- I think we have
entirely misunderstood the character of time. We are not being pushed by the
force of causal necessity, we, we human beings, are reacting to the siren song of
the transcendental object at the end of time. We are on a collision course with
an event for which there is hardly language. We are on a collision course with a
temporal vortex of some sort. It has become a cliche of modern parlance and
journalism that time is speeding up, that history is moving faster and faster. I
take this perception very seriously, because I actually take all perception very
seriously. I would always prefer a direct perception than a theoretical
construct, and so I would like to suggest to you that what is happening on this
planet is that time is being speeded up in our species, we are under the
influence of a kind of strange attractor which is moving us through the temporal
medium at an ever-faster accelerating rate. This is a law of the universe, though
not one recognised by science. (Hopefully, I will change that sad state of
affairs.) Because you can see that the early universe immediately after the
hypothesised 'Big Bang', was an incredibly simple place. There were no organisms,
there were no molecules, there were not even atoms, there was only a pure plasma
of electrons and as the universe cooled, levels of complexity crystallised out
successively, each one building on the previous level of complexity, so
eventually the temperature in the universe dropped low enough that electrons
could settle into stable orbits around atomic nuclei. Well, in that case, then
you get atomic physics. Those atoms condensed into stars and eventually the
temperature and pressure in the centre of those stars was sufficient to trigger
fusion and heavier elements, like iron and sulphur and carbon, are then cooked
out of these stars. Well, then once you have carbon, with it's four-valent
quality, you have the possibility of molecular complexity, an entirely new domain
of complexification. Well, not to belabour the point, but quickly out of
molecules come highly complex polymers, out of highly complex polymers come early
replicating molecules, from them prokaryotes (the earliest living cells,
non-nucleated), then the nucleated cells, the eukaryotes, then clusters of
colonies, colonies of cells, the earliest organisms, then more complex organisms,
eventually higher animals. Out of them, binocular, bipedal primates with an
opposable thumb. Out of them, language-using, mushrooms-using, orgiastic humans.
Out of them, history, cities, warfare, hierarchies, writing, mathematics, music,
and in the twentieth century this all knits together into some kind of global
organism. Now, the horror of science is that it denies the importance of this
phenomenon... [END SIDE 1]

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... this phenomenon at all. For science, the most important phenomenon in the
universe is the move toward heat-death and entropy. They barely notice that life
represents an amazing and persistent exception to the rule that all thermal
dynamic systems run down, life has achieved the miracle of a stability far from
entropy through the miracle of metabolism.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, notice that in this little scenario I sketched out where complexity
emerges out of simpler states, that each ascent to the next order occurs more
quickly than the process before it so that we are in a kind of tightening spiral,
one of William Butler Yates's gyres, we are wrapping ourselves around a cosmic
endpoint of some sort, and this is what I call the transcendental object at the
end of time. It beckons across the dimensions, it throws an enormous shadow over
the enterprise of human history. This is what drives the guru to make his
statement, this is what kindles the messiah to his mission, this is what inspires
the painter and the dreamer and the musician, it's that there is this enormous
source of affection and concern for humanity that is calling us toward it, across
the planes of lower-dimensional time and space. And the miracle is that through
perturbing our neurochemistry in ways which shamans have always done, we can turn
to the last page, as it were, and we can see then that all this process was
actually toward a good cause. We are moving toward the most profound event a
planetary ecology can encounter. We are about to witness the freeing of life from
the chrysalis of matter. This is what our privilege and our destiny is, is to be
the final generation of people with one foot in the material realm of the
battered primate and one foot on the ladder to godhood.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I asked the mushroom once about the social chaos at the end of history,
and the mushroom said 'No worry, bro. This is what it's like when a species
departs for hyperspace." There's a little shimmy in the landing zone as we take
off. So the metaphor that I have created to try and calm people and to make it
possible for us to go into this future with dignity and hope -- which I think is
the only appropriate response -- is the metaphor of birth. If you had never
heard, if no one had ever informed you, of the facts of life, and you were
suddenly to come around the corner and encounter a woman in the act of giving
birth, this situation vibrates medical emergency -- blood is being shed, clearly
there's a great deal of physical pain and agony, pleading, a sense of
helplessness, it looks as though an enormous tumour is metastasizing out of
someone's body. It would be a real leap of faith and understanding to be able to
contemplate that for the first time and to know or to guess that this is how
nature does it, this is how we move to the next higher level, this is what is
happening to us. Matter and the human body is the placenta of the soul and it is
certainly true that the earth is the cradle of the human race, but no infant
remains in the cradle forever. Again, to harp back to the birth metaphor, if it's
time for birth to occur and it doesn't occur, then you do have medical emergency,
what's called toxemia sets in, dangerous to the mother, fatal to the foetus, the
two must be medically parted jolly quick or there will be permanent
repercussions. This is why we must aid this birth process, because it is painful,
life is sculpted out of death and the feeling that we as a species have in this
moment is the feeling that the foetus has, I think, as it moves into the
narrowest neck of the birth canal. Gone forever are the endless amniotic oceans
of peace and tranquillity when we could rape and pillage and burn and explore to
our heart's content because the earth seemed infinite in extent. Now, we have the
same feeling that the foetus has as it starts down the birth canal -- we can't
breath, there's no oxygen, we can't get food, we appear to be ... the walls are
moving in to crush us.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have to understand is that this is the narrow neck that we have been
trained for, this is our destiny, nine times in the last two million years the
ice has moved southward from the poles, miles deep. Your ancestors, my ancestors,
were there, they didn't drop the ball, and they didn't have antibiotics and
advanced medical technology to see them through. Think of how much suffering and
how much nobility and how much love has gone in to getting you to this moment.
You represent an unbroken chain of responsible, intelligent, coherent people and
it ends in us, and so then Tolstoy's question 'What is to be done?'

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is to be done? What we have to do is swallow hard, in a similar way that
the Russians had to swallow hard, and admit we did it wrong, we did it wrong, and
now the only way out is back, we must return to the archaic world of shamanism,
mutual respect among men and women, a sense of seamless cohesion with the living
world. If this is not done, then the experiment fails. Blake talks about falling
from the golden spire into eternal death. This is a real possibility. This is the
realm of existential decision, and it's not about confronting the government with
massive force or publishing hortatory tracts or any of that, it's about doing
larger doses more frequently and discussing it with one's friends. Perhaps this
will develop into a much larger movement than it is, I'm not really interested in
that, I'm interested in deepening the experience of the core peerage and that's
the people who are here tonight -- none of us are loaded enough, at least I
haven't met anybody who is and I certainly am not -- we must live the faith that
we are trying to promulgate because it is done, as every shaman knows, by
example, and therefore I would like to suggest to you, since we look pretty much
like everybody else or a slice of everybody else wandering around in London
today, that you look around at the people in this room, this is your peer group,
you know, we are not of the same class, of the same colour, we have not
originated from a particular line, but we are an affinity group and in the same
way that every affinity group, every coherent social entity has had to claim its
place in the sun, we have to claim our place in the sun. They're not handing out
freedom to anybody, they're not handing out social respect to anybody -- ask
black people, ask gay people -- the only way you get respect in this respect in
this society is you take it, and I think this is the cusp upon which the
psychedelic community now teeters. We were here before in the '60s and when they
came with machine guns we just melted into the woodwork, nobody was ready for
that, so now there must be a new strategy by stealth, by worming from within,
we're not dropping out here, we're infiltrating and taking over because it's our
world and our children's world and we're not going to see it run over the edge by
a bunch of constipated gentlemen -- that's not the plan. 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I think I've run over here a bit, not too much, but I just want to
reiterate to you because it puzzles me and it's the compass of my existence. This
is not shut and jive, this is not another Swami or Baba or anything like that,
those of you who doubt me I'd like to point out to you that DMT only lasts 10
minutes and I think it would be obligatory on anyone who thought they were going
to carry out a critique of this position to just get that experience under their
belt and once that is done rather than carry on a critique, I think most people
will join up, because this is incontrovertible evidence, incontrovertible
evidence of the presence of the transcendental in our lives. That's what I was
seeking, never dreaming that I would find it. By the time I was on the threshold
of it, I didn't believe in it, you know, I had accepted all that marxist crap and
all that existential stuff and the reductionism of science and the rules of
evidence and all this stuff they hurl at you, that's all malarkey. The thought I
would like to leave you with tonight, which you can verify for yourself in the
confines of your own flat later, is the world is not only stranger than you
suppose, it is stranger than we can suppose, and I tell you that gives a lot of
permission for supposing.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[question from audience -- inaudible]

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, we're going to have a question and answer session here -- I hope you're
first off the mark because that's what I'd like to talk about. The format for
this evening is we're going to have about a 20 minute intermission so you can
stretch your legs and exercise your consumer rights over at the book table, and
we'll be hearing a couple of rave cuts that my voice has been slyly integrated
into. First of all, these are -- this is an exclusive premier, by the way, these
records will not be released until later this year -- re-evolution by the Shaman
and tribal drifts version of Shaman I Am. So let's take a....

<h4>Question and Answer Time</h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q: [inaudible]

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM:  The question is 'What do I think psychedelics have...'

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q:  No, no, what do you think happens to us after physical death?

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM:  Yes, well, my answer would have to be based on psychedelic experience. I
described in my talk this encounter with these
self-transforming...self-transforming machine elves. And, you know, if you take
this kind of experience seriously to the point where you actually feel an
obligation to produce a rational explanation, then it would seem to me that in
spite of its radical nature, the most conservative explanation that you could
come up with as to the nature of these entities is that since they are
intelligent, since they seek to communicate with human beings, perhaps they are
human beings. And then the only kind of human being they could be is a dead human
being and, you know, even I found that a bit of an intellectual stretch to
imagine that what the push toward scientific rationalism was going to eventually
lead to was an erasing of the distinctions between the living and the dead. But
when you go to shamans and expose them to DMT and then say, 'So what about it?',
they say 'Well, these are the ancestors. Didn't we tell you that we do our stuff
by ancestor magic?' And then you have to say 'Well, then, aha, now I'm getting
the picture'. An ancestor is a dead person, but you know in the DMT state, these
things don't... it isn't Aunt Mini and Uncle Ned, these are far removed from any
association to us and our world. You know, when Patrick converted the pagan
Irish, he invented the doctrine of purgatory that had previously not been church
dogma and he invented the notion of purgatory to convince the pagan Irish that
their belief in fairyland in a nearby dimension inhabited by diminutive dead
soles could be assimilated to Christian dogma, and this worked so successfully
that then it was accepted as general church dogma and very successfully used to
convert Slavic people as well.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think ... you know that line by W. B. Yates about 'Once out of nature I
would be a thing of gold and gold enameling'? It's as though the transcendental
object at the end of time which the shaman encounters, and the individual
apocalypse of the human soul at death are mirror images of one another -- as
above so below. That's why I'm always amused that people resist the idea of the
end of the world, when you can be damn sure that their world is going to end,
because some day they're going to slip beneath the sod, so we find the end of the
world incredible and improbable as a notion, but it's actually guaranteed for
every one of us. As far as, you know, any tried and true data on the after death
state, I really couldn't say. My style is more to model and then to hope to
improve models later. I did turn on a very high Tibetan Lama to DMT once, and he
said after settling back on his heels 'It's the lesser lights'. What it meant for
him was that it was a kind of near-death experience. He said 'You can't go
further than that without the thread of return being broken'. So, you know, I
think DMT is an excellent tool for studying death. I think there is very little
reason to rule out the possibility that something survives physical death because
nature is so economical, and with such variety of form, can memory and the
perfection of the individual personality be all for naught? I'm not sure, I don't
know, certainly it's an interesting question. I think, you know, a deeper
definition of what a psychedelic life is, is that it's a life lived in constant
preparation for death, the big trip, you know, you want to learn the way. This is
what the shamans say, they say, you know, 'We're living people, who can go to and
from the after world and this empowers us in a very special way'. Now, I need
another question, but I can't see anybody.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q:  Do you still believe ??? in 2012?

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM:  Do I still believe in the apex of novelty in the year 2012? Well, for
those who aren't familiar with my work, when I talked tonight about the spiral of
involution and the way in which each advancement into novelty happens more
rapidly, I was not just whistling Dixie. I have a mathematic formulism which I
chose not to bore you with tonight -- and you should be thankful I assure you --
which leads me to the conclusion that rather than a Big Bang at the beginning,
10, 12, 19 billion years ago, a more pleasing cosmology would be what I call 'the
Big Surprise'. And the Big Surprise comes not emerging out of a pure vacuum for
no reason, but the big surprise emerges out of the integration of complexity into
one final holographic spin-down of all dimensions into a single point. I crib
from your own Alfred North Whitehead informing these ideas, because Whitehead had
this idea of what he called 'concrescence' and he said, you know, that the
universe had an appertition for novelty, an appetite for novelty that moved
toward a nexus of concrescence, and I believe that, yes, we are so close to the
transcendental object at the end of time that really it is going to occur
probably in late 2012. The reasons for being so specific are too complex to go
into now, but I'll just give you a short of throw-away explanation which is
that's the end date of the Mayan calendar. That's not why I chose it, but I
later, after choosing this date, discovered it was the end date of Mayan
calendar. Well, the only thing I have in common with the Maya, they took
mushrooms and I take mushrooms, so it's almost as though, you know, this is the
bar code stamped on the psilocybin paraphoniae, when you get it all pieced
together, no matter where in time and space you are, there's this vector pointing
at the early years of the 21st century as the place where we, where it becomes
explicit that we are in a process of exponential transformation.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, to me it's explicit already. I mean, I cannot deal with a city like
London or Manhattan without saying, you know, measured against the background of
organic nature, this represents some fantastic mutational phenomenon. I mean
whether it's good, whether it's bad, who knows, but it certainly is peculiar and
it certainly is happening very very quickly. That's why I think that it's a bunch
bum(?) to think that you're suspended in a universe which will endure into some
unimaginable future. As I mentioned a moment ago, each one of us is going to die,
rather soon, so why not assume that whatever that transformation is it will be
general, and then prepare to meet it as a collectivity, not the death of the
rationalist and the reductionists where we return to worms, but, you know, the
death of Blake and of Revelations and of the Tao Te Ching and the Tibetan Book of
the Dead -- the death that is victory, the transcendence of matter. That's what
death is, and what we need now for the good of the planet and for ourselves is to
somehow find a doorway into the imagination, that's where the future lies. Our
powers have grown too great to be unleashed on the surface of a fragile planet.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q:  ??

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM:  Oh, dear, you know cannabis. 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q:  ??

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM:  Well let me answer that. The question is that I urged higher doses and
greater frequency, and the question is: do I really think that endlessly
revisiting these places has something to be said for it. Is that a fair re-phrase
of it? Yeah. Well, I don't find these places readily rationally apprehensible. I
go back and look again and again and I'm astonished every time, but I'm willing
to entertain the possibility that I may be a bit slow. The thing about it is that
it exceeds intellectual grasp, you know, you finally come against something where
you say 'This is not an unsolved problem, this is a mystery, it will not yield to
closure'. And one of the things I'm fascinated by is I think that the way we need
to live -- or that's maybe too strong -- the way we need to mentally balance our
karmic accounts is to not seek closure, to Understand -- for heaven's sake, I
mean you're a talking monkey, where is it writ large that you should be able to
model the cosmos in all its complexity and glory? Better than having an anxiety
about the absence of a complete explanation, we need to live in the open-ended,
risky but exhilarating domain of openness and just, you know, live your life
under the shadow of the great 'who knows', because the tales that were told are
fairy tales. Science is a fairy tale, you know, economics is a fairy tale,
political theory a fairy tale -- nobody has the faintest idea what's going on. We
are not in command of the situation at all. That, in one way, is empowering,
because it means, in the words of the dourest philosopher, Ripo Yang(?) 'Worry is
preposterous'. So all I would say to address your question operationally is, if
raising the dose isn't making it more interesting for you, then, you know, maybe
you should found a side branch of the church, because to me it's an ocean, you
know, and my mind is a thimble and I go to the ocean and it's crashing in. I'm
actually like an ant with a thimble, attempting to fill that thimble from
incoming surf -- risky business, what? -- and each time I take away a little bit,
but the richness of it, as I said, I think it exceeds the grasp of apprehension.
Somebody else -- or did you, did you had a two-part question.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q: [inaudible]

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM: The question is: do I really think this stuff poses... god, what a
question to ask. It's like if I wasn't dangerous before, I will be after I answer
this question. The question is: do I really think this stuff has a political
efficacy, or is it just some kind of elitist masturbatory artschool trip that
isn't taking us anywhere? Yes, I absolutely believe that the issue is a
maintenance of social boundaries and that this is done through conditioning and
propaganda, not rationally contrived because it's been going on too long, it's
just how we are. We are conditioned to submit to powerful male figures, we are
conditioned to value the material world over the inner world, we are conditioned
to chase money, all of these things, and these.. you see, if you don't take
psychedelics -- or at least in my case, there may be other ways to reach this --
but in my case, if I didn't take psychedelics I would believe that culture is
truth. Culture is not truth. Culture is other people's trash, you know, the
detritus of thousands of years of mistakes, that's what culture is, and I think
[applause]... So, as to why I'm allowed to walk around and advocate this stuff,
well, first of all have you noticed I use big words? That stamps me as an
intellectual, the most pitiful creature in the human zoo and never to be feared
by any power or establishment anywhere. No, I think basically the powers that be
and the structures that are in place are like a dinosaur.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q:  ??

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM: Pardon me?

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q:  ??

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM: Do I feel that they're going to carry on regardless? No, because you see,
what's happening is that the contradictions in their system are reaching epidemic
proportions. The people who run, I don't know, the Bank of England, the IMF, the
UN Security Council, whoever, they have studies sitting on their desks which tell
me that business as usual has been removed from the menu, that in fact the
atmosphere is being destroyed, that in fact the planktonic life in the sea is in
danger -- and that's the bottom of the food chain -- that in fact the toxic mess
in the East Bloc -- radioactive and otherwise -- is insoluble at this point. So,
you know, it's not heads who are alone in awakening to the fact that we are
either headed for a nightmare of social collapse and catastrophe, or we are
actually going to mutate toward angelhood, but, you know, blundering through, as
we've done for the past thousand years, is no longer an option. Within the next
30 years we are going to have to discuss and contemplate things that would stand
your hair on end and things that to people of another generation are going to
seem incomprehensible. I mean, what are we going to do? Are we going to download
ourselves into a supercooled cube of gold ytterbium alloy buried a thousand feet
deep on the dark side of the moon and wander through an ersatz electronic
wonderland forever? Are we going to atomize our consciousness and spread it to
redwood trees and coral reefs and termite colonies? Are we going to build ships
the size of Manitoba and depart for the galactic centre? What exactly is the plan
folks, because business as usual is off the menu, and you know, in the '60s these
substances were called consciousness expanding drugs, it was just a straight
phenomenological description, consciousness expanding drug or substance. Well, if
you take that notion seriously for a moment, then you need to stop and apply
attention to this matter, because consciousness, the lack of consciousness is why
we are going mad, because we cannot solve our problems. If there is one chance in
ten thousand that these things actually increase in any measurable domain
consciousness, then, by Henry, we should be leaning into it full bore, because if
we don't get our act together, you know, the fossil record has a place for failed
experiments and I'm not interested in that. [applause]

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q:  ??

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM: No, I just think that's a description of the process I'm promoting from
the point of view of someone who doesn't like it. The best and the brightest did
desert the power structure because the power structure was essentially a merchant
of plutonium, paranoia and mass death and propaganda. Yes, the values of Western
civilisation are insupportable. The values of Western civilisation are held to
the planet the way a madman holds a gun to his temple. That's what it's going to
lead to. For instance, take something like free markets -- this is the clarion
call of the politically correct at the moment. Free markets means the right to
manufacture and sell junk everywhere, it means, you know, nobody will be able to
say no. We don't want free markets, we want trade to be as difficult as possible
and the more high tech and machined the object is the more we want to make it
difficult to move it around, because what we must do -- and I'm not a luddite ,
I'm not anti-technology, I'm anti-materialism, we must dematerialise the
accouterments of the culture. I can imagine a world where people live in idyllic
pastoral naturalism, naked with perfected ageless bodies, it looks like an
aboriginal high Paleolithic existence, but when you transport yourself into these
people's bodies and they close their eyes, what they see are menus hanging in
mental space and these menus are generated by an object on the inside of their
eyelid no larger than a contact lens and that object is a doorway for them into a
virtual global culture that is electronically instantaneous, multi-levelled,
multi-sensory, transformative, you know, the complete database of the species on
call at a glance, and so forth and so on. This is a reasonable technological
goal. If we cared for it as much as we care for atom bombs and epidemic diseases
deliverable by artillery shell, we'd have it today. So, you know, the wrong
dreams have been executed, the dreams of the paranoia, the psychotic and the
dominator, and what we need now are dreams that celebrate consciousness,
difference, variety and empower meaning, because the philosophies and the points
of view of the last thousand years leave you with a mess of pottage, leave you
with no explanation. Our religion as a culture is incomprehensible to 99 per cent
of us. I mean, who would care to stride up here and solve a tensor equation? And
yet that's, you know, the holy writ. We are completely alienated, so alienated
from ourselves are we that when we encounter our own souls in the psychedelic
dimension, we mistake it for a UFO. This is serious alienation folks, I think we
have to get back into the inner jeweled realm and make ourselves at home there.
Is there a woman? Yes.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q: [female] Inaudible.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM: Speak louder.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q: [still inaudible -- but in connection with 'emotional hangups']

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM: Are you thinking of a particular substance?

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q: ??

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM: Well, you know, we have to genuflect to LSD for what it did in  the
'60s, but I'm into plants, and I found LSD to be abrasively  psychoanalytical
is how I would describe it.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q: ??

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM: In your experience. In my experience it was very different. Mushrooms, if
they address your personality at all, seem to do it very gently. LSD -I
understand why the psychotherapeutic community was so excited because LSD really
did seem to confirm the models of the psyche that were current at that time. I
mean, you did experience childhood memories, often traumatic, and you did re-live
painful experiences. I don't seek to imply that taking psychedelics is easy or
pleasant. I think that the phrase 'recreational drug' is extraordinarily
pernicious. It is a path requiring great courage and self-discipline because, you
know, the fear can rise up and haunt you and, you know, these things can come at
you that are completely unexpected -- ecstasy is not to be confused with mere
delight. I mean, ecstasy shakes you to the very core of your being because it's a
<i>coincidensia positorum</i>, you know, it is orgasmic and it is terrifying and
it is transcendental and it is mundane. I mean, it exceeds categories, that's
what it is, it's the experience of the melding and transcending of categories. I
don't think everyone should take psychedelics. I think that people who
instinctively fear it are self-diagnosing themselves as mad and therefore they
shouldn't take it. They're right, they <em>know</em>, they <en>know</em>, believe
them! Over here?

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q:  Inaudible.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM: Yes, I think you're quite right that it's a calling. Shamanism is the
name of the calling and you <em>know</em>. You know whether you want to be an
architect or a psychotherapist or a tennis star, and people know whether they
want to be a Shaman, and those who do become exemplars for the rest of us. I
don't think we need to make the mass revolution here, I think we need to empower
a core group of people deeply and profoundly and that they know who they are. You
self-select yourself, and make your way toward it over a lifetime. I mean, it is
a path, and those receptors in your brain which make the psychedelic experience
possible are, like everything else about you, under the control of your genes, so
that it's reasonable to talk about affinities for this stuff, family lines where
it is more commodiously integrated and received -- I think that's very real. We
are biochemically unique, every single one of us, and this addresses that
uniqueness. What these people who become the shamans must do is they must -- by
impassioned speech, poetry, dance and theatrical display -- convey the feeling to
other people. This is what the high Paleolithic was about, you know. We must
share our art, we must open a doorway and some will pass through the doorway and
some will stand and gaze through the doorway and some will only be enlivened by
rumour of the doorway, but the doorway must be secured, made real. It's part of
our birthright, it's the thing without which we are not ourselves. You know, I
see history as the story of the prodigal son, we have wandered in the deserts of
materialism now for two thousand years and our cataloguing, our relentless
probing of the world, of the aboriginal, and the frontier of geography, has
brought into our [END SIDE 2, TAPE 1] 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIDE 1, TAPE 2

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM: Okay, well I think of this talk as "Alchemical Youth on the Edge of the
World", because I thought what we would do this morning is anticipate the
psychedelic '90s, and talk a little bit about the youth culture that is emerging
worldwide and some of the other considerations that the youth culture seems to be
building bridges toward. Altogether, these various concerns seem to me to add up
to a kind of neo-shamanism, or a kind of archaic revival of social forms, many of
which have been suppressed for several millennia.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several facets to this new emerging psychedelic youth culture of the
nineties. First of all, obviously, the ecology movement. This is something that
was absent in the '60s, when the awareness of the approaching degradation and
destruction of the natural environment had not advanced nearly as far as it has
today. So there is a general awareness in the youth culture that its elders are
handing on to it, a looted, polluted planet, in which very little planning or
provision was made for the saving of resources for any future generation. So the
ecology perception is part of the emerging social phenomenon as is feminism.
Feminism has been with us now for about 15 years, but gone through various forms
and rescissions and seems now to have taken the form that is very concerned to
recover the religious attitudes that prevailed before patriarchy and history
established themselves. In other words, we know that at some point in the past,
10 or 15 thousand years in the past, there was a partnership society which imaged
its supreme deity as Gaia, a goddess of the Earth. And a re-awakening of the
awareness of Gaia -- and this really goes to the ecology movement as well -- a
reawakening of this feminine, ecological, earth-centred awareness is definitely
feeding into the aesthetics of this new counter-culture that is arising. Now,
another facet which is somewhat paradoxical and, perhaps on the surface, in
seeming opposition to the concerns of ecology and feminism, is what I call
"cyber-culture" or "hacker-culture". This means that a lot of people in the 16 to
30 year old bracket are very aware of the underground uses and applications of
technology -- not only computers and virtual reality and game-making, but also
desktop publishing, garage band rock and roll, and a counter-cultural record
industry that often runs on very small pressings of very obscure groups and
sounds. Nevertheless, this technological cyber-culture is what is making possible
another facet of this youth culture, which is a specialty music, a transformed
rock and roll, a culture-wide re-invigorating of musical forms and, of course,
driving that concern is the rediscovery of psychedelics. Psychedelics which were
very big in the '60s in the form of LSD largely, were almost lost sight of in the
'70s and the early '80s when the management-oriented yuppie culture came along.
But now, with ecology, with feminism, with cyber-culture in place and
cross-fertilising each other, psychedelics have become the natural glue for this
movement, and they are largely plants. What is going on is an attempt to
recapture the shamanistic institutions and styles that existed before history,
and this means not only cannabis -- which has been with us throughout the 20th
century, throughout all the counter-cultural and alternative moves of the 20th
century -- but also largely mushrooms, mescaline, and so forth -- special
emphasis probably being given to mushrooms because mushrooms have gone from being
an obscure tropical deep-forest endemic to being something which can be
cultivated in any garage or cellar in the land, and many people are doing this.
It's sort of an odd fact about mushrooms that the qualities you need to take them
are precisely the qualities that you will inculcate into yourself if you learn
how to grow them -- punctuality, cleanliness, attention to detail, so forth and
so on. I really think that the mushroom-growers within the new culture are the
alchemists of the new culture; their formula is a rye to mould and mould to gold,
and thank God for them, because they then create the juice that fuels the
creativity of these other concerns that I've mentioned.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really, the psychedelics in my view should be seen as enzymes for the
imagination or catalysts for language, and really what the new youth culture is
attempting to do is to reclaim the language-forming machinery for itself. A
culture can evolve no faster than its language evolves. What is unspeakable is
unthinkable and consequently part of the task of the new spirituality of the
neo-shamanism is to empower language to go into areas where it has never gone
before, particularly the area of emotion. It's incredible how few words we have
for our emotions when we have so very many words for even relatively obscure
technical processes. So I see the psychedelics as functioning in two areas --
first of all to catalyse and empower the imagination and then, secondly, to
dissolve boundaries between people. I mean, if you look at 25 thousand
psychedelic experiences, the impression that you will have is this experience is
one which dissolves people's boundaries -- it doesn't matter whether they're
Hassidic Jew, a communist party apparatchik, a rainforest shaman -- if they
expose themselves to these psychoactive psychedelic plants, they will call into
question their most basic beliefs and assumptions. This is what gives the
psychedelics their inevitable political edge, because the establishment and
maintenance of boundaries is something that most societies are very concerned
with and put a lot of energy into. This is why in the '60s the spread of LSD was
viewed with such alarm by the Establishment, because it appeared that the
machinery of right-thinking, Christian capitalist society was simply being
dissolved before the startled eyes of its purveyors by virtue of the fact that so
many people were calling into question the assumptions of the culture that they
were inheriting.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, now we see something similar coming into being. Thirty years after the
'60s we appear to be poised on the edge of another youth decade, another decade
in which youth will set the social agenda for society at large and attempt to
lead us away from some of the more lethal and self-destructive patterns that we
seem to be so addicted to. Well, now, why is this happening right at the moment?
Well, I prefer to think, rather than arguing rationally about it, that the reason
the 20th century has been so repeatedly disrupted or enlivened -- depending on
your point of view -- by these eruptions of the avant garde, the Bohemians, the
beatniks, the hippies, the youth culture of today, is because unconsciously we
are actually responding to the presence ahead of us in the future of what I call
'the transcendental object at the end of time' -- a kind of strange attractor, a
kind of sociological black hole that reaches out to social processes in the act
of evolving and puts a certain spin on them, calls them toward itself, so that
history in the 20th century is not a random walk or a trendless fluctuation as we
are taught in the academy. Rather, history in the 20th century is a triumphal
march toward the revelation of a transcendental object that lies beyond the turn
of the century.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time we take a psychedelic compound, every time we slip into reverie,
trance or dream, we form a relationship, we encounter in mental hyperspace, the
long shadow of this transcendental object. It's as though we've been moving along
a surface for a long time now, many centuries, and now we are about to undergo a
phase transition or fall off the cusp of the phase space. And this falling off
the cusp of the phase space is, for those who experience it, a dizzying sense of
freedom, a dizzying sense of penetration into a dimension that was previously
sensed and dreamed of but which very briefly and occasionally comes forward to be
realised. It's a gold age, similar to the gold age of Greece or the renaissance,
but for us it has a different character because this transcendental object ahead
of us in time seems like a kind of concrescence of all our hopes, fears and
intuitions about what the future and the evolution of our species could become.
This is, I believe, why the UFO has been such a persistent motif in 20th century
popular culture. It's because we actually sense on the unconscious level a kind
of approach of the end of time, a kind of closing distance between historical
societies and some kind of truly mysterious, truly transcendental object that
lies ahead of us in the future, in the near future. And again returning to the
subject of the psychedelics, their role in all of this is that they seem to pick
up and amplify that signal coming off this mysterious object hidden in the
future, so that the contents of psychedelic experiences, when laid end to end in
a composite, is to give a kind of picture of what this final scenario of global
integration is going to be like. And though it is going to emerge as a phenomenon
of culture, I think it will largely come out of not our cultural artifacts, not
our technology, but out of human organisation itself.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not for nothing that the self-transforming machine elves that one
encounters on the other side of the DMT barrier, that what they seem to be
concerned with is the teaching of invocation and forced evolution of human
language. I think that somehow the part of human organisation that is most likely
to undergo an evolutionary transition is the portion related to the production of
language. Even ordinary language, which we take so for granted, when looked at
from the perspective of the rest of animal nature, is seen to be something very
close to the thumbprint of God on the human world. I mean, you can take your
dolphins and your ants and compare them to a Grateful Dead song or Milton's
Paradise Lost, and it's clear that human communication is going on in a domain of
glorification and completeness that is transcendentally Other when compared to
all other forms of communication going on in the world. Well, then, isn't it
suggestive that when we use these tryptamine hallucinogens -- hallucinogens which
are strangely enough analogous to neurotransmitters within our own brains -- that
then what we burst through to is the equivalent of a kind of shamanic finishing
school where self-transforming machine elves -- apparently the animal life of
this parallel continuum -- are urging us to perform some kind of transformational
act on our own language.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I had this experience for many years before I found anything in the
world of human experience, ethnography, or art history that could be mapped onto
it, and then in the early '70s I took myself to the Amazon and I discovered there
groups of tribal people using a combinatory brew called Ayahuasca, a visionary
brew made of giant woody liana called <i>Banisteriopsis caapi</i> and a small
leafed plant containing DMT, called <i>Psychotria viridis</i> And when these two
plants are brought together and brewed together for many hours and then boiled
and concentrated, a very powerful psychedelic substance results and the people in
these deep forest, rainforest areas have been using this shamanic preparation for
thousands and thousands of years. When it was first encountered in the early
years of this century, the compound was isolated and actually called telepathene.
This was to refer to the apparent group states of mind that the people using this
brew were getting into. Well, later it was realised that the compound had
previously been isolated from the giant Syrian rue, Peganum harmala, and that the
compound had already been named harmaline, so telepathene disappeared from the
literature in favour of harmaline. But the thought is worth noting that from the
very beginning the early explorers, ethnographers, anthropologists who contacted
this folkway in the Amazon assumed that it had something to do with group states
of mind. Well, what I discovered -- and I certainly wasn't the first to discover
it -- in the Amazon in the early '70s, was the people in these tribal groups get
together and they take Ayahuasca and their habit is to sing to make music, vocal
music. They have no drums because in the Amazon the humidity is so high that no
drum head could remain stretched more than a few hours. So the people use rattles
and leaf shakers and vocal sound to produce what we would think of as beautiful
tribal music. But what's interesting about this beautiful tribal music is after
each performance, when you sit and listen to the people criticise the
performance, they don't say that it sounded very good, they will inevitably make
comments like 'I like the part with the silver bars and the blue dots, but I
thought that the yellow could have been more intense, especially where it faded
into the polka dot brown and grey section'. In other words, when you listen to
these people in these native contexts criticise these performances, you realise
that for them it's a visual performance, it's sound which, under the influence of
these plants, is actually beheld, actually <em>seen</em> by the people within
this culture.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this was very exciting to me because, you see if you can see a situation
from another person's point of view, in a sense you have become that other
person; to stand in the other guy's shoes is to see the world from that person's
point of view. It's a very different way of relating to language than the way we
ordinarily do it. You see, the ordinary way in which human beings communicate is
one person makes small mouth noises, the small mouth noises move across through
the air as acoustical pressure waves, they then enter the mind brain system of
another person and that person consults a culturally validated dictionary to see
if their definitions overlap with the definitions of the person who created the
sounds in the first place. Now, if there's sufficient overlapping, then we say
that communication is taking place, that understanding is occurring, but it's
always a very provisional and shaky kind of understanding. And as concepts become
more complex, dictionaries become more incomplete and more divergent, and
eventually two people of the same culture, they're discussing a highly technical
question, may have no understanding of each other at all. Well, this is very
different from the situation that arises if we could literally see what the other
person means. It's not without implication for this argument that when we talk
about perfecting communication, we unconsciously reach for visual metaphors, so
someone will say 'I see what you mean', or 'She painted a picture', or 'his prose
was luminous'. This means that we instinctively and unconsciously believe that
meaning is something most clearly apprehended when seen, and one of the things
that has excited me so much about the aboriginal use of psychedelic plants is
they seem to be on the brink of evolving forms of communication which move out of
the realm of acoustical neurological processing and into the realm of visual
acoustical processing.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this has tremendous implications for the new world order that the youth
culture is seeking to put into place. Cyber-culture, music, psychedelics,
feminism, ecology, the new spirituality, all of these concerns could profit and
strengthen themselves by appealing to a visual language, a new way of processing
what is heard. This is what I think art in the 20th century has unconsciously
been striving for, ever since jazz and cubism and throughout the evolution of
12-tone row, abstract expressionism, rock'n'roll, pop-up virtual reality -- all
of these schools of art and technological innovations in the art-making process
are setting us up to be able to see what we mean at some point in the future. And
this will deliver us essentially into the equivalent of a telepathic society.
Now, you may have imagined telepathy as something different, you may have
imagined it as one person speaking and another person hearing the thought
composed, but this isn't it. Telepathy will be nothing more than seeing what the
other person intends -- seeing meaning.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, why it is that when we dose ourselves with a human neurotransmitter like
DMT, why we then encounter armies of elves teaching us a perfected form of
communication, this is a very difficult question. When you go to traditional
cultures, shamanistic cultures in the Amazon and put this question to them, they
answer without hesitation when you ask about these small entities, they say 'Oh,
yes, those are the ancestors, those are the ancestor spirits with which we work
all of our magic'. This is worldwide and traditionally the answer that you would
get from shamans if you were to ask them how they do their magic -- it's through
the intercession of the helping spirit who is a creature in another dimension.
Well, we may have imagined many different scenarios, a future technological and
social innovation, but I think very few of us have imagined the possibility that
the real programme of shamanism would have to be taken seriously, and that
shamans are actually people who have learned to penetrate into another dimension,
a dimension where, for want of a better word, we would have to say the souls of
the ancestors are somehow present. It isn't, you see, as though we penetrate into
the realm of the dead, it's more as though we discover that this world is the
realm of the dead and that there is a kind of higher-dimensional world with
greater degrees of freedom, with a greater sense of spontaneity and a lesser
dependency on the entropic world of matter, and that that other universe is
attempting to impinge into our own, perhaps to rescue us from our historical
dilemma, we don't know -- perhaps shamans have always had commerce with these
magical invisible worlds and it's only the sad fate of Western human beings to
have lost touch and awareness with this domain to the point where it comes to us
as a kind of a revelation. You see, I believe that the whole fall into history,
the whole rise of male dominance and patriarchy really can be traced to a broken
connection with the living world of the Gaian mind, and there's nothing
airy-fairy about this notion; the living world of the Gaian mind is what shamans
access through psychoactive plants, and without psychoactive plants that access
comes as an unconfirmable rumour.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the social style of human beings 15 to 20 thousand years ago
was very very different from the social styles of today. In the first place,
people were nomadic pastoralists, they didn't stay in one fixed area, but rather
they followed around behind their flocks. And there, in the manure of these
ungulate animals that had evolved with the primates on the grasslands of Africa,
was the mushroom, and the mushroom was acting as a tremendous force for directing
the evolution of human beings away from that of the rest of the anthropoid apes
and toward the unique adaptation that we see as special to human beings today. It
was doing this through a series of self-reinforcing tendencies that are easily
enough understood. First of all, when you take small amounts of psilocybin, such
small amounts that no psychological experience is apparent at all, there is a
measurable increase in visual acuity. Well, you don't have to be a rocket
scientist to realise that if a hunting animal is in a situation of high
competition for resources and there is an object, a food item in the food chain,
which imparts increased visual acuity, then those animals which admit that item
into their diet are going to outbreak the non-mushroom-using population and gain
a significant advantage by this means. Well, it doesn't stop there. If slightly
larger doses of psilocybin are taken, still sub-psychedelic doses, you get what
is called CNS arousal, central nervous system arousal. Now all this means is a
sense of restlessness, an inability to sit still, a sense of energy and -- the
classical meaning of arousal -- sexual arousal. What this means then is that
those animals in the population that were more successful at hunting and at
obtaining food because they were taking small amounts of psilocybin are now going
to act out what primatologists call 'more successful instances of copulation'.
This means a lot more sexual activity is going on and wherever you have sexual
activity, it stands to reason you're going to have increased instances of
impregnation and successful birthing. So, the second factor which builds on the
first factor is the mushroom-using population will tend to outbreed the
non-mushroom population, and it will tend, then, to survive into adulthood in
greater numbers because of the greater increased success in hunting. 
<a name="psilang">The third and final factor</a>, then, which pushed 
these mushroom-using primates into a position of ascendancy, is [that] 
psilocybin at the psychedelic dose level actually stimulates the areas of 
the brain that are concerned with the production of language, so you get 
spontaneous glossolalia, spontaneous bursts of modulated syntactically 
structured sound, and I believe probably that language was invented
long before meaning as a kind of abstract exercise around the camp fire, 
that these homonoids and protohomonoids were doing for each other's 
amusement. So there you have a three-step process -- increased visual 
acuity means increased success at getting food, further doses of 
psilocybin mean more sexual activity with more instances of successful 
impregnation and birthing of offspring and, finally, contact with the 
language-catalysing psychedelic <i>tremendum</i> that even for people as 
sophisticated as ourselves looms as the most tremendous, shocking and 
challenging mystery in our world.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have always been caught up in the anticipation of the unspeakable. The
human adventure has always been a flirtation with these gigantic forces in an
unseen dimension. This is what sets our religions going, this is what creates
gurus and messiahs and scientific breakthroughs, it's that somehow we are in
resonance with something much larger than ourselves, something which you could
call the great attractor, the transcendental object at the end of time, the Gaian
mind, whatever it is, we, out of all of nature, seem to have a special
relationship to it and seem to be somehow both under its care and somehow
involved in the manifesting of it in 3-dimensional space. It's that as we make
our way across the historical landscape toward the sensed presence of this
transcendental other, so it is making its way toward us through the content of
dreams, psychedelic experiences, the careers of spiritually advanced people, --
the idea being that history, which is a state of extreme instability and
disequilibrium which only lasts 15 or 20 thousand years, that history is about to
be transformed or ended, that the factors that shaped history -- phonetic
alphabets, male dominance, materialism, scientific method, empiricism -- these
factors are about to be made obsolete by discoveries in the human and natural
realm.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, we the people of the high-tech civilisations, are like the prodigal son.
We made a descent into matter. We have wandered many years in the wilderness.
Now, in a time of great planetary crisis, we must return to the tribal fold. We
must take what we learned from the peregrination into history and return to the
tribal model with it. Only in that way, then, can we reclaim our sexuality,
reclaim our identities and reclaim the planet for itself. The styles that have
evolved within history, the styles of male dominance, concern for tracing male
lines of paternity, private property, control of females, so forth and so on, all
this has arisen as a result of the establishing and maintaining of the ego. The
ego is the function of the personality that is most at home and at ease within
the context of history, but really this is not a situation of mental health, the
ego is like a calcareous tumour that arises within the dynamics of the psyche and
lodges like a cancer or a tumour in the structures of the psyche. And the only
cure or the only treatment that I am aware of for the calcareous tumour of ego is
frequent repeated exposure to psychedelic plants. This is the essence of their
boundary-dissolving function, and 12 to 20 thousand years ago the ordinary style
of human society was, as I said, nomadic pastoralism and psychedelic intoxication
on a schedule that was very probably lunar, so reclaiming that orgiastic
boundaryless style of sexual relating is part of what the archaic revival is
about. Obviously, with a population of six or seven billion people, we can't
seriously suggest that we return to the sexual styles of a group of nomadic
pastorilists on the plains of Africa who numbered probably no more than 50 or 60
people, but we can understand that the ego is a function that has arisen, in a
sense, to empower our most lethal tendencies. Because as we look at the Earth as
it exists today, with rising levels of toxicity and pollution and arms
proliferation and so forth and so on, there are no problems that cannot be solved
-- we have the technology, we have the money, we have the industrial capacity,
what we don't have is the plan and will to execute the plan.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So really the change that we and the groaning planet are waiting for is a
change in the human mind. It's the human mind that must change and then the tools
for the restructuring that must be done will be found present and near at hand
and, as far as I can tell, we don't have centuries or millennia in which to do
this change and if preaching alone could have inspired it, it would have occurred
several millennia ago. What we must look for is a catalyst that is effective, not
on the easy cases but on the hard cases, and when we carry out an analysis of
that sword, what we're going to find is psychedelic shamanism is the traditional
human response to our dilemma. We must dissolve the boundaries of yours and mine,
of inside and outside, even of life and death. We must dissolve these
linguistically conferred boundaries and replace them with a sense of the
universal flow of energy through a series of vibrating and resonant fields of
being. This is the core philosophy that lies behind Shamanism, Buddhism, Taoism,
this is the perception of the perennial philosophy, and I believe that using the
lessons of the 20th century -- what was learned at Auschwitz and in the
Haight-Ashbury, and at Alamogordo and Nagasaki -- using the lessons of the 20th
century, the new youth culture can at least create a viable human alternative.
We're approaching the change of the millennium, we're about to go into the third
millennium, and we can actually use the change in the calendar as the wind
beneath our wings to lift us to a new vision of global completeness and of
species and planetary holism that will then leave us the fitting inheritors of
the birthright of the elfin empowerment. 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we've said enough. I think we can knock off. If they can't get seven
minutes out of that we have to renegotiate.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIDE 2, TAPE 2

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM:  ... damn well better stay away from psychedelics. No, I don't think
everybody should do it. I think revolutions are made by 15 percent of the
population and that you can have a psychedelic society and be a citizen of a
psychedelic society and never take psychedelics, but the ambiance of the society
will be psychedelic. You know, it's a calling, shamanism is a calling, and if
you're not up for it -- my own biography is perhaps instructive in this, I mean
the reason I'm into all this is because I'm into what's weird, I always have
been. I mean, I've always loved the bizarre, the <i>ourtre</i>, the stuff of the
edge, and you know, when I got to psychedelics I thought I'd hit the mainframe of
sprung verse or something. I mean, if that's what you like, then this is your
answer. You see, what the psychedelic is going to do is it's going to destroy
your whole world, your whole conception of your world, and some people that's
tremendously liberating, they say 'wonderful, at last I'm free of it', other
people say 'My God, now I'm hopelessly mad, I have nothing left to cling to, I've
really done it this time', and so that's almost an aesthetic judgment, whether
you like watching your world shredded before your eyes and made into nonsense -if
that makes you feel liberated and secure then you can sign up for that carnival.
If that alarms you then I think best to stick to the tried and true. It's not for
people of weak psychic constitution, and what shamanism is about is -- I mean, I
know someone who says of the mushrooms 'My goal with taking mushrooms is always
be able to stand more', and they don't mean higher doses, they mean more of what
it reveals, and I feel like that. I mean, the mushroom speaks -- I didn't really
stress this in my talk, but the strange, the confounding fact about these
mushrooms is that they speak to you, in plain English, and this is completely
unexpected. How can such a thing be? I mean, one is dumbfounded in the presence
of this, and yet by being able to have an 'I/thou' relationship to this thing,
you open up yourself to what is essentially a magical dimension, a dimension of
ally-ship with this thing. I come to this completely as a rationalist, I mean I
am more scientist, more rationalist than anything else. I am very uncomfortable
with my position in the New Age, I hate all that stuff -- the quartz crystal
suppositories and the channeling of dead Egyptians and all this horrible stuff
which goes on, I mean it's just an affront to the thinking mind. But when I
encountered these psychedelics, I said 'My God, scepticism is the proper path',
and I believe this -- it's not to believe, it's to test. I said to the mushroom
once 'Why us?', meaning my brother and me, 'Why us?'. And it said 'Because you
don't believe in anything', you know 'You're not a believer', and so it's a real
thing, it's a real mystery. It will not yield to reason, it's a tremendously
well-kept secret. I mean, how can it be?

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, take the case of dimethyltryptamine, DMT. This is the most
powerful psychedelic in existence. It only lasts two or three minutes. This most
powerful of all psychedelics we naturally elaborate in our own brains. This is a
curious fact. It means that psychedelics, to be what we call 'powerful' or
'overwhelming', are not chemically alien to exotic to the brain, but they are
rather very familiar and very much like things already present in the brain. And
when you smoke DMT the entire world is replaced in about 30 seconds with
something completely impossible to anticipate and utterly astonishing, utterly
astonishing, I mean the character of the experience is almost that of pure
astonishment. I mean, people have said to me 'Can you die from smoking DMT?'
Well, the truthful answer is 'Yes, by astonishment'. Death by astonishment is a
real problem here and this is the rarest of all emotions. I mean, when was the
last time you were astounded, you know, struck speechless with amazement? We have
these phrases in our language 'struck speechless with amazement', but if it
happens once or twice in your life I dare say you'll remember it until they lower
the box. Well, DMT delivers this on demand. Well, what is so astonishing about
it? Nothing less than breaking into an inhabited elf nest of self-transforming
machine creatures who are squealing and squeaking in a visible glossolalia that
falls like rain on the interior landscape. There isn't even ordinary space and
time -- this occurs 30 seconds after availing yourself of this compound and you
are restored to normalcy eight minutes later. It means these things are not far
away, it is not destructive, it is not inimical to the organism, it simply is
suppressed by culture. We don't understand how enclosed we are by the prisons of
a limited and scientific language. True weirdness is raging just outside the
confines of the cultural paradigm which is trying to reassure us 'Oh, it's all
very humdrum and all runs down into entropy and I shouldn't worry about it if I
were you'. This is not, in fact, the case. However, I digress. 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q:  ??

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM: By the New Age? 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q:  Yes.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM: Well, I hope I didn't come off as terribly hostile, I'm sort of
light-heartedly critical is where we're shooting for here.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q:  ??

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM: Oh, I'm sorry, yes. The question was 'Given my view of the New Age, what
do I make of the appropriation of shamanism by the New Age and its marketing?'
Well, if it's non-psychedelic I absolutely deplore it. I mean, I'm not here to
name names, but I'll assure you the major marketers of non-psychedelic shamanism
were turned on to the power of shamanism by their experiences with psychedelics
and I take a very hard-core position on this just to infuriate people. I really
don't believe there's any other way you can get there. I mean these yogic states
and states induced by starvation, flagellation, celibacy -- all these
tremendously pleasant methods -- are not to be compared to the psychedelic state.
I don't know what those people are talking about. One of the things that concerns
me is, people say 'Well, this is a spiritual path and you're a spiritual
teacher', and so forth and so on -- no, I am not a spiritual teacher and anyone
familiar with my moral behaviour can assure you of that. I don't know whether
this has anything whatsoever to do with the spiritual quest as ordinarily
conceived. My approach to it is it's a phenomenon of some sort that confounds our
notion of reality. The thing which got me started on my travels and my career
writing about all this was I had been very keen on Carl Jung and all that
business and had been raised Catholic, and so when I smoked DMT I had the
expectation that the most far-out thing that would happen, that could indeed
happen, would be a kind of revelation of the Jungian archetype, the great round
dance of the archetypes would be made visible. Well what was completely
dumbfounding, was there was no relationship to the DMT flash, to the art history
of the species. Our art doesn't hint of these dimensions, very aptly, and yet
this is available to all of us. It's so suppressed that it's not even in the
human unconscious. It's been suppressed below the level of the human unconscious.
It's as though it's a lost world, a parallel continuum, and if you have access to
this lost world, this parallel continuum, it would never enter your mind to
invent mathematics, government, religion, all of these things, because you are in
the moment, you are at peace with yourself and your community, and this is
something that we have to make our way back to, because the disequilibrium of
history has turned rather rough and ugly here, post-World War II. 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q:  ??

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM: Thank you for taking your turn, you're next. Vitamin K, let me just say,
and I say this because there's something I want to say. The word 'drug' has been
tremendously misappropriated and corrupted by the movers and shakers of society.
I mean we all, I believe it's safe to say, are repelled by obsessive
self-destructive, unexamined behaviour and that's what is laid at the feet of
drugs. However, chasing dollars or pounds, worrying about making a fashion
statement, owning a Ferrari, all of these things are obsessive self-destructive
habits, so I have a rule, a three-step test if you're thinking of availing
yourself of a substance as part of your programme of self-growth and advancement.
The first question you should ask yourself is 'Is it ...

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q:  ?? afford it.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM: 'How can I afford it', yes, well, that's zero -- moving on to one.
Question one is 'Does it occur in nature?', and question two is 'Does it have a
history of shamanic usage?' You see, if it has a history of Shamanic usage, then
issues like 'Does it cause tumours, miscarriages, blindness, palsy?' -- this has
all been answered, we have our human data, we have five thousand years of use by
the Mazatecan Indians or somebody else, we have our human data sample. Then the
third test is 'Does it occur naturally or do its near relatives occur naturally
in the human brain?', because we don't want to insult the human brain, we don't
want to toxify it, we don't want to poison it. Well, the happy conclusion of
applying these rules is that the most terrifyingly powerful of the psychedelics
pass all tests with flying colours -- DMT being the perfect example. DMT is a
megatonnage hallucinogen -- it occurs naturally in the metabolism of every single
one of us at this moment. If you were an American audience I would tell you
you're holding a schedule 1 drug and are subject to immediate arrest and trial.
Every human being on earth falls into this category. This is the Catch 22 that
they hold in reserve if they ever have to come after us -- you are holding, and
you can't stop yourself. The fact that DMT, that we return to a normal state in
only a few minutes from DMT, argues that the non-invasive quality is very
important. If you take a drug and feel wobbly 48 or 72 hours later or are having
body aches or blurred vision or something like that, this is a drug to stay away
from, this is not something you want to get mixed up in. You judge the
non-toxicity of the drug by how fast your body is able to return you to normal.
MK, which inspired the question, which is ketamine, doesn't pass any of these
tests and I did it and I found the state very interesting, but when I saw the
data on how it depressed the immune system and there's some concern that it may
trigger epileptic kindling, I didn't think it was a good idea. Also the fact that
you have to bang it, that's a bad habit. I don't think we should get into that
because then it's a vector for disease and then pushes all kinds of the wrong
buttons. Yes. 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q:  ??

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM: You mean as opposed..

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q:  ??

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM: Ah, well, the difference will not be great except in the dose ratio. I
think liberty caps are per unit gram stronger than <i>Stropharia cubensis</i>,
but still don't you have to eat a dozen or two of them?

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q:  ??

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM: Three hundred! Ah ha, okay, well -- and good for you! <i>Stropharia
cubensis</i>, I mean, in culture we've grown 170 gram specimens which when dried
down go down to 15 grams. Well, what I always say is a dose is 5 dried grams, and
I might, since we're on this subject, say something about technique, because I
always forget this -- it seems so obvious to me, but it's a revelation to some
people. The way you do these things is you do them on an empty stomach in silent
darkness, obviously. I mean, you're looking for hallucinations, right? This is a
hallucination hunt, it's a vision quest, so people ask the most bizarre
questions, example: 'Will I be able to drive?' Now, there's the male dominator
ego for you. In no sense of the word will you be able to drive. That's what's
going to happen: you're not going to be able to drive, so just, you know, put
that in your pipe and smoke it early on and give up the notion of driving. No,
you should be in silent darkness, and some people resist the silent part and they
say 'But, you know, I always listen to the Mothers of Invention on my ...' well,
give it a rest, friend, you know, they're wonderful on the natch, so let the
pythagory and inner music issue from your soul in silent darkness. You will be
amazed, I mean if it bores you flip on the Top of the Pops, but give it a half an
hour before you resort to that. Yes. 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q:  Have you had any experience of ??

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM: Yes, well I see that the <i>Guardian</i> dutifully reported all one would
need to know to get seriously involved in toad abuse. In America we hear about
toad licking and it's always advanced as a folkway of the primitive Australians
and we in America have gone on one better. First of all, we don't hurt our toads,
we drive out into the desert in our four-wheel-drive vehicles and we gently milk
our toads onto what we call the windshield -- a windscreen -- and then it dries
in the sun and we get out our little frost scrapers and scrape this
better-left-undescribed material off the windshield and then this is smokable.
This is 5-methoxy-DMT from Bufo Alvarius, and it passes all the tests. Well, not
the test as would occur in a plant, no, it occurs in an animal, that's better.
It's interesting, it's one of the few animal-based hallucinogens -- we call it
toad foam, as opposed to more inelegant appellations that have been used. It's
5-mythoxy-DMT, so it's a variety of dimethyltryptamine, but compared to DMT it's
sort of like AM radio versus 70 millimetre cinemascope. There's what I heard a
researcher describe last week as an 'effulgent emotion' -- yes, there certainly
is. There's no word for this emotion, but it's very large, but there is very
little visual activity, kind of after-image-like stuff, but you know on DMT the
hallucinations have an existential veracity that's absolutely jaw-dropping. I
mean, they are 3-dimensional, they are highly coloured, they are in motion, these
elf-like creatures that one encounters in the DMT space are, I've described them
as self-transforming basketballs, they are like jeweled basketballs and they come
toward you and then they recede and they're singing in these silvery voices which
make objects, they have a language which is visibly beheld -- a favourite theme
of mine that we didn't get to tonight -- they make a language which they then
present to you -- the objectified language -- and it looks rather like Faberge
eggs or sorts of toys that alien astronauts might give their children to amuse
them. I mean, when you are shown by one of these -- I call them tykes, these
creatures in the DMT state -- when one of these tykes comes bounding toward you
and offers one of these mechanised syntactical Faberge machines, you look at it
with the perfect knowledge that if you could bring this thing across to this
world, no stone would be left upon another, that there is something about it that
is confounding, it is literally impossible and yet you're looking at it, it's in
front of you, I mean the impossible is happening and, you know, this is a result
of that. Yes. 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q:  ??

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM:  Datura. The question is about datura. I would think of it as a kind of
deliriant, actually. The chemical family involved is tropanes. We don't want to
get too technical here, but a good rule is when I talk about psychedelics I'm
talking about indole alkaloids -- LSD, psilocybin, ibogaine, the so-called
cyclocised tryptamines. I'm pretty narrow-minded about all this. Even mescaline
doesn't quite make it because it's an amphetamine. Datura, the morphogenetic
field that is associated with datura is one of magic working, of the spreading of
delusions, it's often used in contexts where somebody is working their sexual
will with somebody else who may not be into it. I remember what put me off datura
was years ago I lived in Nepal and a friend of mine -- actually an Englishman --
I met him one day in the market and we were just making the small talk there, and
it came to my attention from talking to this person that he thought I had paid
him a visit in his apartment. He was under the impression that we were sitting in
his apartment having this discussion, when in fact we were moving around in an
Asian souk, so I thought this is a level of disconnection from reality that we
don't need. The thing that's interesting about the indole hallucinogens, and
especially about DMT, is there's a core portion of your being that is never lost
hold of, that is always observing. And I remember on ketamine one of the things
that put me off about it was this is such a reality-obliterating compound that in
every trip you come to this moment in which you realise with the force of a
revelation 'I'm stoned, that's what's happening, now I remember, I'm a human
being, I'm on a trip, this is a trip, I'm on a trip'. And then it all falls into
place. Well, what this is telling you is it's nearly over and that you were so
cut off from being able to understand that what was going on, you could never
remember that there had ever been anything preceding it, you could never
anticipate that anything would ever follow upon it, you completely accept this
impossible situation. So, I don't like that, I like holding on to this observing
eye. Now this may be my own ego clinging to the last grain of ego, but
nevertheless I think it's very important that there be a clarity of something
throughout the experience and datura seems to erode that fairly seriously. Well,
I'm getting the high sign. Oh, one more question. One more. 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q: You bandied chemical words around quite freely here ???

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM: Sorry, I thought you were permitting a question -- you're asking  a
question.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q: .. chemical terms around, quite freely...

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM: Oh yes, oh yes.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q: ... but many people feel that marijuana is a liberating agent. Is 
marijuana ??? hallucinogenics that you're mentioning?

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM: Well I don't know if 'poor cousin' is the word. Marijuana is the "except"
to all the rules. Marijuana is a polyhydric alcohol. I can't say enough in praise
of marijuana. I mean... [applause].. the lifeblood of my inspiration, and, yes,
it's interesting. Sometimes I teach a whole weekend and this never comes up, I
mean, we're all so well behaved. Here we are discussing these outlandish drugs,
you know, when the fact of the matter is cannabis is our daily bread, and ...

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q:  ??

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM: Yes, I mean this is this notion that community comes first, that there is
a family, there is a tribe, I mean what people say... I observe this very closely
because I got into therapy, strangely enough, with a therapist who I thought was
quite brilliant except she knew nothing about drugs, which was a preposterous
situation for me to be in, and so she said 'Well, now, this cannabis business,
how many times a day do you do it?'. I said 'oh, by the dozen', and she said
'Well, oh, and how many years have you been doing this?', said 'Twenty five', she
well 'Well, surely, this is ...' and it kept coming up, so finally I said 'I'll
quit, I'll quit so that you see that nothing happens so that you won't be running
around the countryside laying this trip on your patients, because nothing will
happen'. Well, so then I did quit for two months, and what I noticed was a
tremendous narrowing of my consciousness, to the point where before it was over I
was staying up late nights working on balancing my cheque book and studying
receipts and plotting how to chisel on the tax man with my receipts and just the
most horrible mundane consciousness. Well, then, you know, you take a puff of
cannabis and you think about Moliere's dentures, and the causes of the fall of
the Trebizondian empire and the really important stuff of life, you see, rather
than your own stupid ego trip. Back here I promise and then we're out of here.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q:  ??

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM: Ah, ecstasy. Well, I don't want to insult the local choice. I  assume
you mean MDMA.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q:  Yes.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM: Too bad, I'd rather have answered the general question, I think ecstasy
is wonderful. MDMA is problematic. Every drug -- some of the most bizarre drugs,
like cocaine for example -- every drug when it makes its debut in the marketplace
-- LSD, cannabis -- is hailed as a love drug, and so it was with MDMA. My
personal experience was that it was never as good as the first time, which seemed
to me a bad thing, that you know you want to learn, you want to work with these
things, you want to be able to take them somewhere, and what I observed in
America was people just took it to party. Well, too little is known about it to
do that. There is considerable irrefutable evidence that it makes very long term
changes on the dendritic processes of the nerve. My brother is a research
pharmacologist, he did much of that work in Steven Parutka's(?) lab at Stanford.
So as far as what ecstasy does, the subjective effects on the subject, it's fine,
I'm all for that, but it doesn't have the clean bill of health that it would have
if we could get it out of a plant and point to a culture that had used it for
five thousand years and could point to compounds in the brain that it closely
mimics. This is the division, this is what I stand for, I stand for the plants,
the plants have souls, they carry the morphogenetic field of thousands of years.
When you take psilocybin, it takes you, you are participating in all the trips
that it ever induced in anyone, and this is a tremendously stable field of
experiences. When you take a drug fresh out of the laboratory it has no soul, it
has no story, it has no direction, it's a product of the demon artifice of man,
and I prefer to put my hand in the large hand of the Goddess and make my way into
this dimension under the aegis of the sanctioned vegetables that for millennia
have always been there to fling open the doorways to vistas of pleasure and
delight that would make you turn up your nose at the best Beverley Hills has to
offer. Believe me, believe me, the inner riches are incomparable, and this is how
we recover our dignity, by not being whores to Mammon and pursuing all of this
trash that they're peddling to us, and insist instead on the maximising of human
values, human emotion and human community. 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q: ??

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM: No, no, maristisan(?) is a fairly distantly removed precursor, you're 
screwing up my avalanche to conclusion here. 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q: Would you please say something about ???

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TM: Well, we've arrived rather late at that subject, haven't we. Yes, well,
I'll just give you the... I'm the purveyor of a bizarre notion which was told to
me by an elf troupe. It's a formal mathematical notion that argues very strongly
-- and had we had a second evening to get together I would never repeat myself,
we would talk about something entirely different. I think that we are headed
toward a planetary transformation within our lifetimes, specifically around 2012
AD, and this is not a political transformation, or a biological transformation,
it's an actual transformation of the laws of physics themselves, that the
presence of creatures such as ourselves on this planet is an indication of the
nearness of what I call the transcendental object at the end of time and it is
like an attractor. It is like an energy pocket in the epigenetic landscape into
which we have fallen and that the fury of 20th century culture is indicative of
our nearness to this globally transformative moment that will emerge out of
ourselves. Essentially, we are going to shed the monkey, the linguistic creature
that is symbiotic with these monkeys is about to disentangle itself from
<i>physis</i> and realise some kind of angelic transformation. Very difficult for
us to anticipate or understand. If I had more time I would say more, much more,
but that's all folks.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to say that to make these ideas real we have to overcome the very
format that we objectify tonight. Any one of you could have sat here and done
this. This rap means nothing if it isn't a democratically available mystery -- no
hierarchy, no special knowledge, no specific racial background, no degree is
necessary. This belongs to all of us, and I want to wish you well with your
community-building and with the vision that is coming to fruition here. Very
important, very empowering for the rest of us in other parts of the world. Keep
up the good work. I hope you invite me back. Thank you very much.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New speaker: Thank you, Evolution have been delighted to invite you this
evening. Have a very nice time and have a very safe journey home. Bye bye.
