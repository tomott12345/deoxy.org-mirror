<h2>The Human Evasion <font size="+1">by <a href="http://www.celiagreen.com">Celia Green</a></font><p>
<font size="+1"><a name="1">Chapter 12 : Christ</a></font><br></h2>

<p> <br>
Sane human beings are not interested in reality. This is clearly shown
by the attitudes of both Christians and sceptics towards the origins
of Christianity. Both factions are primarily concerned to attribute
"human" emotions to its founder&#151;nice modest fair-minded ones or
nasty perverted abnormal ones according to taste. Neither side pauses
to consider whether the available documents are remotely adequate to
support their interpretations.
<p>
Now in fact the historical evidence is of such a kind that the
question may reasonably be asked whether Jesus lived at all. None of
the gospels can be dated much earlier than A.D. 57, and probably all
the four synoptic gospels were written around the latter half of the
first century A.D. There is every reason to suppose that the tradition
had already been subject to many influences, some identifiable, some
debatable. There is no reason to suppose that the writers of the Gospels
were any more interested in facts than most sane people are. In fact
the internal evidence clearly suggests that they had no inhibitions
about modifying their text when they wished to make it support a
particular point.
<p>
It is difficult to base any conclusions whatever on documents of this
kind.
<p>
It is certainly impossible to see how they can be made to support
statements of the kind sometimes made by Christians&#151;that they
derive from the Gospels an overwhelming sense of the <i>personality</i> of
Christ. Or, indeed, a statement such as this made by an intellectual
Christian in a University environment:
<p> <blockquote>
The discrepancy between the depth and sanity and (let me add)
<i>shrewdness</i> of His moral teaching and the rampant megalomania which
must lie behind His theological teaching unless He is indeed God, has
never been satisfactorily got over.<a href="12.htm#12.1">[1]</a>
</blockquote><p>
In fact. there is very little "moral teaching" in the Gospels, and
what there is is not <i>shrewd.</i> It simply makes unreasonable demands,
of the utmost generality, of a kind that any purveyor of mental health
would recommend his patients to disregard.
<p>
As for the theological teaching of Jesus, we do not know what it was.
There is quite insufficient evidence for supposing that he claimed to
be God, though we know that Christians from the fourth century onwards
liked to make this claim on his behalf.
<p>
Probably more credit should be given to St. Paul. He was clearly a
sane person&#151;aware of the need to make a good impression on the
neighbours. It may well be that the true reason for the survival of
Christianity lies in his having adapted it into a form admirably
compatible with sane psychology. Much confusion has been created by
reading the Epistles of Paul as if they shed light on the
interpretation of the Gospels.
<p>
Consider the doctrine of the Fatherhood of God. This is supposed to
have been central to the thought of Jesus. In fact, by all accounts,
he had a positive obsession about it. Christians claim that it shows
him to have been a warm, family-centred man and no cold metaphysician.
Non-Christians claim that it shows him to have a father-fixation,
combined with homosexual tendencies which he sought to gratify by his
dubious relationship with his disciples.
<p>
Now, on grounds of textual criticism, it can be shown that there is
little evidence that Christ himself had any particular interest in the
Father concept&#151;even as a symbol&#151;still less in the Father-Son
combination which is so important to later claims of the divinity of
Christ. Although Jesus is credited with using the term Father
frequently in Matthew and John, this is not the case in Mark, the
earliest of the Gospels.
<p>
In Mark, God is only spoken of as Father in the absolute sense,
without qualification, in two passages, both of which are believed to
be either editorial interpolations or editorially modified.... Moreover,
the expression my Father is never found in Mark, and your Father is found
only in xi. 25-26.<a href="12.htm#12.2">[2]</a>
<p>
In fact, it is virtually impossible to reach any firm conclusions
about what Jesus understood by "God". Attempts have been made to
reconstruct his idea of God from the Jewish tradition of the time, but
there is no knowing what influence this actually had on his thought.
Modern man may like to believe himself the child of his environment,
and his ideas the inevitable consequence of sociological influence.
However, a few people have been known to think, and we cannot be sure
that Jesus was not one of them. (The fact that the religion originated
by him became widely accepted is not, of course, evidence for this
supposition, but against it. If, that is, he did in any sense
originate the religion which became accepted.)
<p>
If he was, he would probably have been capable of using the current
terminology and sayings of his time in a sense of his own. There is no
need to suppose him moronically unintelligent. The use of parables
would seem to imply that he understood the use of metaphor.
<p>
We are not, I think, justified in concluding anything about the
attitudes or opinions of Jesus from the areas of omission in the
Gospels. Obviously we have only a handful of his sayings. The tradition
had had plenty of time, before A.D. 57, to select those sayings which
were reasonably compatible with the developing tradition of the
Church, and to suppress the rest. The fact that we have only metaphor
rather than description or definition to help us decide what he meant
by "God" or "The Kingdom of Heaven" may not mean that he was a simple,
emotional person who never defined his terms. It may only mean that
his metaphors were all of his thought that could survive the
transition into the world-view of the early Church.
<p>
Having said what cannot be inferred from the existing records, we may
settle down to speculation.
<p>
There is an interesting possibility that Christ was not only not
paranoid, but that he was not sane at all, and that the expression
"the Kingdom of Heaven" refers to a state of mind not likely to be had
by sane people. Let us discuss some of his utterances in the light of
this possibility.
<p><blockquote>
<i>Matthew</i> 13: 45-46
<p>
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking
goodly pearls; who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all
that he had, and bought it.
<p>
<i>Mark</i> 8: 36-37
<p>
What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and
loose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
</blockquote><p>
To suggest that one single thing could be worth more than everything
else put together is, I feel sure, an immature attitude.
<p><blockquote>
<i>Matthew</i> 7: 13-14
<p>
Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the
way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:
Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto
life, and few there be that find it.
</blockquote><p>
This is scarcely democratic and I do not see what a modern Christian
can make of it. But it is a realistic assessment of the number of
people likely to take up single-mindedness at all seriously.
<blockquote><p>
<i>Matthew</i> 22: 37-38
<p>
Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first
and great commandment.
<p>
<i>Matthew</i> 7: 7
<p>
Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it
shall be opened unto you.
</blockquote><p>
Sane people are obviously not likely to qualify for anything on these
terms.
<p>
They cannot want anything very much, or try to get anything very hard.
They accept the first compensation that comes their way.
<blockquote><p>
<i>Luke</i> 6: 24-26
<p>
But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.
<p>
Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that
laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.
<p>
Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their
fathers to the false prophets.
</blockquote><p>
Does this <i>really</i> sound as though he was in favour of the jolly,
well-compensated man-in-society?
<p><blockquote>
<i>Matthew</i> 19: 21-23
<p>
Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou
hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven:
and come and follow me.
<p>
But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for
he had great possessions.
<p>
Then Jesus said unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich
man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.
<p></blockquote>
A rather more interesting reading becomes possible if it is supposed
that "riches" means "compensations".
<blockquote><p>
<i>Matthew</i> 6: 31-33
<p>
Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall
we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? (For after all these
things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that
ye have need of all these things. But seek ye first the kingdom of God,
and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.
<p></blockquote>
Modern Christians hold that the thing to do is "obviously" to feed
everybody in the world, and until we have done that, we needn't ask
what anyone is to do with their life, anyway. The question is whether
Christ would have agreed.
<p><blockquote>
<i>Luke</i> 18: 16-17
<p>
But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to
come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.
<p>
Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God
as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.
</blockquote><p>
It has been suggested that what Christ found attractive about children
was what sane people like about them&#151;their uncritical trust in the
superior wisdom of adults, their plasticity, submissiveness,
suggestibility, and vulnerability. However, children have other
characteristics besides these.
<p>
They are excitable and like excitement. They are in a hurry; it seems
to them that to do a thing <i>now</i> may be altogether different from
doing it tomorrow.
<p>
They are easily bored. They ask questions. They want to grow up to be
the first Emperor of Space.
<p>
In short, they seek intensity of experience. They do not have much
experience of life and they may seek it clumsily. As they grow older
and saner they learn not to seek it at all.
<p><blockquote>
<i>Matthew</i> 12:25
<p>
Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and
every city or house divided against itself shall not stand.
<p></blockquote>
Modern enlightenment suggests that Christ was talking about the
integration of the personality. The modern idea of integrating the
personality is to accept all the bits of yourself on their own terms&#151;enjoy <i>all</i> your pleasures without imposing upon them any rigid
formalism. But this may not have been exactly what Christ had in mind.
For one thing, modern people regard integration as a function of
maturity&#151;but Christ seemed to think children in some way eligible.
<p><blockquote>
<i>Matthew</i> 6: 22-23
<p>
The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single,
the whole body shall be full of light. But if thine eye be evil, thy
whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is
in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!
<p></blockquote>
This makes it tolerably clear that if he was talking about the
integration of the personality, it was a single-minded sort of
integration.
<p><blockquote>
<i>Matthew</i> 6: 24
<p>
No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and
love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other.
Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
<p></blockquote>
It has been suggested that "mammon" means crude, ambitious,
materialistic commercialism. Perhaps it just means "society", or even
"other people".
<p><blockquote>
<i>Matthew</i> 15: 9
<p>
But in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the
commandments of men.
<p>
<i>John</i> 5: 44
<p>
How can ye believe, which receive honour from one of another, and seek not
the honour that cometh from God only?
<p></blockquote>
Would Jesus <i>really</i> have liked the idea that Christianity meant
social conformity and lots of welfare work?
<p><blockquote>
<i>Matthew</i> 10: 35
<p>
For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the
daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her
mother-in-law.
<p></blockquote>
Not-sane people need not expect sane people to see eye to eye with
them.
<p><blockquote>
<i>Luke</i> 8: 19-21
<p>
Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at
him for the press. And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee. And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it.
<p></blockquote>
Undemocratic.
<p><blockquote>
<i>Matthew</i> 9: 16-17
<p>
No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that
which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent
is made worse.
<p>
Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break,
and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine
into new bottles, and both are preserved.
<p></blockquote>
Perhaps this means "You cannot be sane and not-sane at the same time."
But even supposing a sane person had a moment's excitement, would he
not try to weld it into his ordinary world-view&#151;to "integrate" it,
as he would say?
<p><blockquote>
<i>John</i> 12: 25
<p>
He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in
this world shall keep it unto life eternal.
<p>
<i>Luke</i> 12: 25-26
<p>
And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?
If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye
thought for the rest?
<p></blockquote>
Does this sound like settling down happily within your finiteness?
<p><blockquote>
<i>Luke</i> 1: 37
<p>
For with God nothing shall be impossible.
<p></blockquote>
This could be a statement about the total uncertainty. For its
philosophical status, see <a href="12.htm#9">Chapter 9</a>.
<p><blockquote>
<i>John</i> 10: 34
<p>
Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are
gods?
<p></blockquote>
A most unpopular piece of Christianity. Sane people do not <i>want</i> to
be gods; they want to be ordinary-members-of-society-like-anybody-else.
<p><blockquote>
<i>Mark</i> 11: 25
<p>
For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain,
Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in
his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come
to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.
<p></blockquote>
No sane person doubts the impossibility of moving mountains by
will-power.
<p>
Philosophically, however, it cannot be shown to be impossible.
<p><blockquote>
<i>Matthew</i> 13: 35
<p>
I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of
the world.
<p></blockquote>
This may sound megalomaniac. But there is no great difficulty in
keeping secrets from sane people. The incredibility of the fact of
existence retains the status of a closely-guarded secret in spite of
its accessibility to inspection.
<p><blockquote>
<i>Mark</i> 13: 35-37
<p>
Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh,
at even, or at midnight, or at the cock-crowing, or in the morning:
Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.
<p>
And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.
<p></blockquote>
Whatever this may mean, it certainly demands a psychological attitude
which is improbable in the sane. Live as though you expected the
unexpected? As though something might happen?
<p>
However, if Christ was trying to talk people out of their adherence to
sanity, he made one fatal mistake. He said "Love your neighbour as
yourself." No one who understands the human evasion could fail to
realize that any statement which could be interpreted as an
exhortation to pay attention to <i>other people</i>, even if among a great
many injunctions to single-mindedness and unconditional desire, would
be the only one remembered.
<p>
In fact, everyone <i>does</i> love their neighbour as themselves. They
desire that he shall accept the second-best as they have done; that
he, too, shall be made to realize his limitations and "come to terms
with himself".
<p>
The other aspect of Christ's thought that has seized upon the popular
imagination is, of course, the use of the Father-symbol. If Christ was
not sane, he may have meant something peculiar by "Father", and not
necessarily something very human. He may even have meant something
like "the Outside" or "the origin of existence".
