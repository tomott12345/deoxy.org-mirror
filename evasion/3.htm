<h2>The Human Evasion <font size="+1">by <a href="http://www.celiagreen.com">Celia Green</a></font><p>
<font size="+1"><a name="1">Chapter 3 : The Genesis of Sanity</a></font><br></h2>


<p> <br>
It is fashionable to locate the origins of psychological attitudes
very early in life. The taste for doing so is not, perhaps, entirely
unmotivated.
<p>
It is obviously fairly agreeable to regard one's psychology as the
result of conditioning rather than of choice. It is relaxing; one has
nothing to blame oneself for; one cannot be expected to change. It is,
of course, possible that the infant mind is capable of significant
emotional decisions, but this possibility is never discussed.
<p>
However, a perfectly satisfactory beginning may indeed be postulated
for sanity, and this does not interfere at all with standard theories
of psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysis deals with that part of a person's
psychology which has become fixated on <i>other people</i>; so it may well
describe what happens to the child in so far as that child becomes
sane.
<p>
It is well known that the younger people are, the less sane they are
likely to be. This has lead to the heavily-loaded social usage of the
term <i>maturity</i>. It is an unquestionable pro-word. Roughly speaking,
the <i>mature</i> person is characterized by willingness to accept
substitutes, compromises, and delays, particularly if these are caused
by the structure of society.
<p>
Young people are usually <i>immature</i>, that is to say, they wish their
lives to contain excitement and purpose. It is recognized (at least
subconsciously) by sane people that the latter is much the more
dangerous of the two, so the young who cannot at once be made mature
are steered into the pursuit of <i>purposeless</i> excitement. This is
actually not very exciting, and is well on the way to an acceptable
kind of sanity, as it leads to the idea of "excitement" being degraded
to that of "pleasure".
<p>
Adolescents are known to think about metaphysics more than most
people; thus thinking about metaphysics becomes associated with the
negative concept "immaturity". If someone thinks about metaphysical
problems at a later age, they are said to show signs of "delayed
adolescence".
<p>
Now let us go back to the very beginning of the "maturation" process.
It is to be presumed that a baby which is being born experiences
helplessness as helplessness. That is to say, it experiences the
painful and incomprehensible process without any of those reflections
which are such a miraculous source of comfort to the sane&#151;such as
"It will soon be over", or "After all, it happens to everybody", or
"It shouldn't be allowed. It's <i>their</i> fault".
<p>
The infant may be presumed to find its condition intolerable&#151;because 
it is out of control of it. At this point of its life, what it
minds about is that it cannot control reality, not that it cannot
control people.
<p>
Now so long as one is finite&#151;i.e. one's knowledge and powers are
limited&#151;situations may always arise which one cannot control. But it
is very hard for an adult human to feel any emotion about his
limitations vis-a-vis impersonal reality. What emotion arises in you
when you think that you would be quite unable to lift Mount Everest?
On the other hand, it is probably quite easy to feel some emotion at
the thought that so-and-so is an inch taller than you are, or can
always beat you at badminton. You may also (though less probably)
still be able to feel a pang of jealousy or regret that you are not
Nijinsky or Shakespeare or Einstein.
<p>
Obviously a process of psychological development takes place which
ensures (so far as possible) that the limitations of the individual
will be experienced <i>only</i> in comparisons with other people. Now it is
obvious that the emotion which accompanies the original experience of
helplessness is very strong. If you can recall any experience of
impotent fury or horror in early childhood you may get some idea of
this. This gives some clue to the strength of the <i>human evasion</i>. If
people are to take the force of all this displaced emotion, it is
scarcely surprising that they should be the object of such exclusive
attention.
<p>
At first very young children are not immune from a feeling of
helplessness <i>per se</i>. But it may be presumed that the part of their
environment which is most readily manipulable is soon seen to be
<i>other people</i>. The younger the child, the truer this is. Its own
physical and mental grasp of the situation is greatly exceeded by that
of adult humans&#151;particularly its mother&#151;who can affect the
situation in its favour if they feel inclined to do so.
<p>
It is very painful to try to do something and to fail. The
retrospective attempt to reject the combination of trying and failure
is well known in social life. "I didn't really care about the game
today." "Actually I was thinking that even if I was elected it was
time I resigned to spend more time on my other interests." Therefore,
by the time it has reached adulthood, the sane person has evolved ways
of relinquishing the attempt in favour of some compensatory aim, in
any situation in which it does not feel almost certain to succeed. For
example, as a mature adult, you cannot even try (with any emotional
involvement in the act of trying) to jump over a house. By the same
token, you cannot <i>try</i> to make a door open by willpower alone, or
<i>try</i> to arrive home quickly without traversing the intervening space
and navigating such obstacles as stairs, walls, gates, etc., in the
approved fashion. Your immediate sensation if you attempted to try,
would be an overwhelming sense of <i>impossibility</i>.
<p>
It is (philosophically or factually speaking) the case that no future
event can be demonstrated to be impossible. If something has happened
once, this may be said to show it is possible. If it has never
happened this does not show that it can never do so. But as has
pointed out, reflections of this kind although <i>true</i>, have no
emotional impact to a sane person.
<p>
As already mentioned, you may still (in rare circumstances) be able to
<i>try</i> to achieve exceptional things in some socially recognized and
strictly limited field. I.e. you may still be able to try and equal
Nijinsky, Shakespeare, etc.
<p>
But it is far more likely that you have acquired some compensatory
attitude towards any such symbols of outstandingness. It can give a
very pleasant sense of gentle superiority to discuss Beethoven's
deafness, and Shakespeare's Oedipus Complex, and Nietzsche's lack of
success with women, in a more or less informed manner. Thus MacNeile
Dixon:
<p><blockquote>
So with the famous monarchs of the mind. They terrify you with their
authority.... How royal is their gesture, how incomparable their
technique!
<p>
There is, however, no need for alarm. Pluck up your heart, approach a
little nearer, and what do you find; that they have human wishes and
weaknesses like yourself. You may discover that Kant smoked, played
billiards and had a fancy for candied fruit. The discovery at once
renders him less awe-inspiring.<font size="-2"><sup><a href="3.htm#3.1">1</a></sup></font>
</blockquote><p>
This kind of approach is not only useful for eliminating a sense of
inferiority, it also makes it much easier to ignore anything Kant,
Nietzsche, Hume, etc., may have said about reality.
<p>
Now although the ambitions of the adult are already restricted to
narrowly defined types of social recognition, even this form of
aspiration is a strictly <i>unstable</i> structure in sane psychology&#151;i.e. 
if it is displaced slightly from its equilibrium it will tend to
fall further away from that position, and not return to it. On the
other hand, <i>compensation</i> is a <i>stable</i> psychological position in
sane psychology.
<p>
The replacement of <i>aspiration</i> by <i>compensation</i> is perhaps most
clearly seen among college students. They frequently arrive at
university with immature desires for greatness and an exceptionally
significant way of life.
<p>
Not infrequently, also, this leads to emotional conflicts and
disappointments of one kind and another. They <i>adjust</i> to their
problems with startling rapidity. The solution which occurs to nearly
all of them, and is suggested to them by psychological advisers, etc.,
if it does not occur to them spontaneously, is to <i>accept their
limitations</i>. The <i>acceptance of limitations</i> is accompanied by a
marked increase in the valuation placed on <i>other people</i>.
<p>
"I used to be quite self-sufficient and thought I wanted to be nothing
but an intellectual. I lived for my work, and of course
maths/classics/anything you like is the nearest thing there is to
heaven. But it would be selfish to live like that. I see now you've
got to take an interest in life&#151;I mean, you have to live with other
people. It's <i>difficult</i> to get on with people. Social problems <i>are</i>
difficult. The other is <i>easy</i>. It's running away from reality."
<p>
What is usually omitted from this exposition by the patient is that
between the period at which classics (or whatever it may have been)
was "nearly heaven" and the period at which human relationships became
the central thing in life, there was usually a stage at which classics
was no longer particularly easy.
<p>
It is a simple law of human psychology, therefore, that as soon as
conflict arises, it will be eliminated by some compensatory manoeuvre
in which <i>other people</i> are the central pivot. The process of becoming
thoroughly sane depends on repeated manoeuvres of this kind.
<p>
This process may be presumed to have started in earliest infancy, when
it was much more rewarding to aim at responses from one's mother than
at controlling the environment directly. Here began the child's
lifelong efforts to limit its trying to regions in which it could
succeed. This process, of necessity, remained imperfect in early life,
as moderate (though never disproportionate) efforts to learn things
must be sanctioned in the young.
<p>
These efforts are almost at once heavily conditioned by social
acceptability, though this is not yet the exclusive criterion. It is
possible to find people who remember, as children, having tried (or
attempted to try) to walk away from the stairs into the air instead of
going on down them one by one. But even then they found it impossible
to try very hard.
<p>
Why is it so painful to <i>fail</i> in something you have tried to do? In
the case of the young child it is evidently because it reminds it of
its limited powers, which suggests the possibility of permanent
finiteness.
<p>
It is bad enough to be finite at present; it is intolerable to believe
that one will always be so. If one tries and fails it proves that
one's trying is insufficient. Better therefore to believe that <i>one
doesn't want to try</i>&#151;at least at present.
<p>
This view of the matter is not so far removed from that of orthodox
psychoanalysis, which does, after a fashion, recognize the child's
desire for omnipotence. Psychoanalysis is, however, most concerned
with what happens once human persons, such as the child's father,
have become partial symbols of omnipotence. There is also a tendency
to describe the child as having a muddle-headed <i>belief</i> in its own
omnipotence. This is, of course, less justifiable than a <i>desire</i> for
omnipotence. Sane people cannot distinguish very easily between
different attitudes of this kind.
<p>
Of course in the child and adolescent there are still remains of the
belief that one will, at some judiciously selected time in the future,
attempt altogether more ambitious things. In true adulthood this idea
has disappeared (or becomes transformed into some such form as "it
would make all the difference if people were only decent to me and
gave me my rights").
<p>
Thus the sane, adult person wants (or tries to want) to have what it
can have and to do what it can do, and exercises a good deal of
ingenuity in attempts to want not to have what it cannot get.
<p>
One or two points must be made in parentheses. The sane person will
not, of course, admit that the prospect of being permanently finite is
intolerable.
<p>
Even if he looks so miserable that he cannot with any conviction claim
to be happy himself, he will utter constant affirmations that "most
people are perfectly all right and quite happy as they are." "Why
should I mind about being finite? Suppose I <i>enjoy</i> it like this?"
<p>
This does not make our hypothesis about the development of the human
evasion any less probable. Our argument is that a sane person's life
has been spent in an increasingly successful attempt <i>not</i> to find
finiteness intolerable. Thus if he makes assertions of this kind, he
is telling us only that he has succeeded.
<p>
After all, it is accepted in psychoanalysis that one of the objects
of a psychological reaction to an unacceptable fact is, eventually, to
conceal the true origin and purpose of this reaction.

<p>
The sane adult will, of course, object that what happens when one
comes up against one's limitations is not that one is reminded of the
<i>possibility</i> of permanent finiteness. It is <i>certain</i> that the limits
of one's capabilities are defined by what one can and cannot achieve.
<p>
The very young child reacts emotionally as if it believed that
limitation is only potential; it does not yet identify itself with its
limitations. In this its emotions are in accordance with the most
abstract philosophy; whatever may be achieved in certain circumstances
on one occasion or even on a great many occasions, it may still be the
case that something quite different may be achieved on a future
occasion. In the most abstract sense, this might simply happen in the
way that everything might stop existing at any moment or start
existing according to different laws. This, I know, is the sort of
consideration that has no force at all to a sane adult. But even
within the normal world-view, it cannot be claimed that very much is
known about the psychological factors that restrict or permit
achievement, and the possibility cannot be ruled out that if someone
adopted a different kind of psychological attitude from any they had
had before, they might find their abilities radically changed.
<p>
Initially, then, the child is merely horrified at the prospect that a
single failure may contain some implication of permanent restriction;
some barrier set forever between him and the possibility of
omnipotence. It is a matter of social conditioning that he
increasingly learns that he is regarded by others as defined by his
failures, so that any single one comes to have the force of a
<i>permanent measurement of what he unchangeably is</i>.
<p>
This process is accompanied by a continuous shifting of the idea of
failure away from <i>absolute</i> failure (i.e. failure to fulfil one's own
will) toward "failure by comparison with other people". To the mature
adult only the latter is of any interest.

The child is trained, then, to react to failure not only by regarding
his limitations as final, but by substituting something more readily
obtainable for what he originally wanted. The substitution is usually
eased by a shift of emphasis from what the individual himself wants,
to what other people want from him. It may be the substitution of a
<i>different</i> ambition from the first one, on the grounds that it will
be just as useful to society, or it may be the substitution of social
approval <i>per se</i> for any ambition at all.
<p>
Consider some well-known gambits. "Never mind, darling. Even if you
fail your exams, you know we'll still love you." If the person
concerned is actually worried about the exams, there is an obvious
motivation for attempting to find this comforting. "Well, we know you
did your best, and that's what counts." The latter is particularly
subtle, since it combines the idea of <i>finality</i> of failure with the
offer of social approval. What it is really saying is: "Provided you
accept that you couldn't possibly have done better, and you really are
worse than all the other boys, you may have our affection as a good
boy who tries."
<p>
Now the child may well have an obscure feeling that in some way he
wasn't feeling <i>right</i> about the thing; or that somehow everything
felt <i>wrong</i> at school in some indefinable way that made it quite
certain that he couldn't do that kind of thing there. But his mind
must be distracted from any attempt to work out how one does make
oneself feel right to do things. (If he does start reflecting on the
effect of circumstances upon him he will most likely be told he is
"making excuses".)
<p>
The denial of psychological reality is very important to sanity. It
cannot afford to admit the existence of a psychology of achievement,
still less to understand it. However, one of the few pieces of
psychology that is understood by sanity is how to make young humans
with aspirations feel discredited and absurd. Any aspiration bears an
uncomfortable resemblance to a desire not to be finite at all.
Inspiration is of little interest to modern psychology; it is about as
unfashionable as witchcraft. If the subconscious mind is considered at
all, it is considered solely as a repository of associations of ideas
about parts of the body and members of one's family.
<p>
Of course there is a kind of non-aspiring psychology of success which
is understood by sanity. It is roughly as follows: the most stable,
least excitable, most normal, people will tend to be most consistently
successful.
<p>
Even if this seems to be supported by observation, it must be borne in
mind that these are the conditions for success (of a moderate kind) in
a society composed of sane people.
