<h2>The Human Evasion <font size="+1">by <a href="http://www.celiagreen.com">Celia Green</a></font><p>
<font size="+1"><a name="1">Chapter 6 : The Sane Person Talks of Existence</a></font><br></h2>

<p> <br>
When the sane person talks about life he sometimes mentions the
Outside, but here a splendid confusion can be created from the simple
fact that <i>other people</i> are, in a certain sense, <i>outside</i> relative
to the individual. And so it is possible to find passages like the
following:
<p><blockquote>
And what, too, would our reactions to (ESP) tell us about ourselves?
That we feel safer living in splendid isolation, <i>a huis clos</i>? Or
that we are prepared to face the possibility of being members of one
another in a world which, as mathematicians already know, is first and
foremost one of relationships, and which now, as a great mathematician,
Hermann Weyl, has dramatically put it, is being made by modern science
itself "to appear more and more as an open one... pointing beyond
itself."<a href="6.htm#6.1">[1]</a></blockquote>
<p>
This, incidentally, provides a particularly ostentatious example of
the use which is constantly made by sane people of words with two
possible meanings.
<p>
Here the word "relationship" is used to assimilate the two concepts
"human relationship" and "mathematical relationship". A little
analytical thought should convince the reader that a person may be
interested in human relationships without the slightest attraction
towards mathematical ones, and <i>vice versa</i>.
<p>
A distinction may be made, though it is a difficult one for a sane
mind to grasp, between the idea of a world "pointing beyond itself" to
mathematical abstractions, and one "pointing beyond itself" to human
mutuality and cohesion.
<p>
This passage also illustrates the habit of talking about human
relationships as <i>terrifying, difficult, dangerous,</i> and the like.
Conversely, any outlook not constantly preoccupied with human
interactions is&#151;though never described&#151;implied to be excessively
conducive of feelings of <i>safety, ease, and comfort.</i>
<p>
There is no particular reason why these implications should correspond
with the psychological facts. As we have already mentioned, 'sanity'
shows many of the characteristics of recognized psychological
syndromes. All psychological syndromes are ways of defending the
individual from intolerable stress, and can only achieve this
objective by concealing their true purpose. So one does not expect
a high degree of objectivity in the statements of&#151;say&#151;a paranoid
about his condition. In fact, one expects a characteristic kind of
<i>inversion</i> on certain crucial points. (Pride replacing guilt,
superiority concealing inferiority, and so on.)
<p>
Now if "sanity" is a device for protecting the individual from the
impact of facts, in the same way that paranoia is a device for
protecting the individual from feelings of humiliation, it is
obviously under the same kind of necessity to conceal its true terms
of reference.
<p>
So it is scarcely surprising that sane people should have an unfounded
belief that they are adopting a difficult and strenuous attitude.
<p>
But what are the psychological facts? Is it actually the case that
when people adopt a less anthropocentric outlook they find themselves
overwhelmed by sensations of ease and self-aggrandizement? We cannot
expect to find very much evidence either way, because people do not
often adopt such an outlook, but such evidence as there is suggests
that they actually feel alone and defenseless, not to say frightened.
<p><blockquote>
In general I dreaded to be left alone. I remember wondering how other
people could live, how I myself had ever lived, so unconscious of that
pit of insecurity beneath the surface of life. My mother in particular, a
very cheerful person, seemed to me a perfect paradox in her unconsciousness
of danger, which you may well believe I was very careful not to disturb
by revelations of my own state of mind.<a href="6.htm#6.2">[2]</a>
<p>
I shall never forget that night of December in which the veil that
concealed from me my own incredulity was torn. I hear again my steps
in that narrow naked chamber where long after the hour of sleep had come
I had the habit of walking up and down. I see again that moon, half-veiled
by clouds, which now and again illuminated the frigid window-panes. The
hours of the night flowed on and I did not note their passage. Anxiously
I followed my thoughts, as from layer to layer they descended towards the
foundation of my consciousness, and scattering one by one all the illusions
which until then had screened its windings from my view, made them every
moment more clearly visible. Vainly I clung to these last beliefs as a
shipwrecked sailor clings to the fragments of his vessel; vainly,
frightened at the unknown void in which I was about to float, I turned
with them towards my childhood, my family, my country, all that was dear
and sacred to me: the inflexible current of my thought was too strong&#151;parents, family, memory, beliefs, it forced me to let go of everything.
The investigation went on more obstinate and more severe as it drew near
its term, and did not stop until the end was reached. I knew then that
in the depth of my mind nothing was left that stood erect.
<p>
The moment was a frightful one; and when towards morning I threw myself
exhausted on my bed, I seemed to feel my earlier life, so smiling and so
full, go out like a fire, and before me another life opened, somber and
unpeopled, where in future I must live alone, alone with my fatal thought
which had exiled me thither, and which I was tempted to curse. The days
which followed this discovery were the saddest of my life.<a href="6.htm#6.3">[3]</a>

<p></blockquote><hr size=1 width=20%><p>


It is true that when people talk about life they do sometimes admit
that being finite is rather awful. Sometimes they cannot even manage
to say this without mentioning "other people" in every sentence. The
following passage from Erich Fromm is interesting because it
illustrates several kinds of question-begging simultaneously.
<p><blockquote>
There is another element ... which makes the need to "belong" so
compelling: the fact of subjective self-consciousness ... its
existence confronts man with a problem which is essentially human:
by being aware of himself as distinct from nature and other people,
by being aware&#151;even very dimly&#151;of death, sickness, ageing, he
necessarily feels his insignificance and smallness in comparison
with the universe and all others who are not "he".
<p>
Unless he belonged somewhere, unless his life had some meaning and
direction, he would feel like a particle of dust and be overwhelmed by
his individual insignificance ... he would be filled with doubt, and
this doubt eventually would paralyse his ability to act&#151;that is,
to live.<a href="6.htm#6.4">[4]</a></blockquote>
<p>
The first thing to notice is that Fromm implies (even before he has
stated the problem) that what a person <i>needs</i> is "to belong". When he
does state the problem he states two problems at once as if they were
the same. (To feel insignificant and small in comparison with the
universe is actually <i>different</i> from feeling those things in
comparison with other people.) Fromm calls this problem (or problems)
"essentially human"&#151;a reassuring description. He continues by
implying that it is right and proper for a person to feel that he does
"belong", and that his life does have "meaning and direction". This
will prevent him from feeling like a particle of dust: if he did, he
would be paralysed. This last is, of course, an unverified assumption.
<p>
There is no evidence that people who feel like particles of dust
<i>relative to the universe</i> become paralysed and inactive, although it
is a fact of clinical psychology that people who feel worthless
<i>relative to other people</i> often spend a good deal of time in bed.

<p><hr size=1 width=20%><p>

Virtually all categories of modern thinkers unite in chanting "There
is no Outside". The existentialists, alone, say "There <i>is</i> an
Outside". On account of their sane upbringing they feel that this is a
difficult thing to say and they say it with a kind of metaphysical
stutter, inventing new words profusely in their desperation to make
themselves understood. Of course in a sense they are right in
supposing that it is difficult; no sane person is likely to understand
it. But the difficulty is emotional, not philosophical.
<p>
(Incidentally, how well the human evasion has arranged matters when
anyone who would say "There is an Outside" is driven to express
himself at enormous length, in all but unreadable books.)
<p>
Existentialists admit that there are certain states of consciousness
in which ideas about death, existence, isolation, responsibility,
urgency and so forth may have some emotional significance. But these
are rare and transitory.
<p>
The weakness of the existentialists' case is that they do not
distinguish sufficiently between a philosophical attitude and a
psychological one. A sane person may be made to admit, as a
philosophical point, that everything is fundamentally uncertain, but
this will not give it any power as a motive force in his life. Even a
person who wished to realize the fact of uncertainty would find it
difficult to perceive it with any vividness, or to eliminate other
emotional attitudes which he saw to be incompatible with it.
<p>
Having accepted that one may, at certain times, become startlingly
aware of certain things, the existentialist argument usually goes on
to talk of "authentic" and "inauthentic" being. If what is meant by
"inauthentic being" is living without awareness of these things, then
obviously everyone is very inauthentic indeed. "Authentic being" would
mean to live in constant awareness of these things, with all the
modifications that would entail. But this is a problem in psychology;
it must be asked what forces are at work to prevent this awareness,
whether it is possible to defeat them, and how. It is particularly
useless to give prescriptions for "authentic being" by involvement
or commitment in the world. If we realize that we are talking about
states of consciousness, it becomes clear that the procedure being
recommended is this: "If you should chance to have a flash of awareness
of things of which you are not usually aware, you will realize that your
life is full of things which seem meaningless to you so long as you are
in this state of awareness. What are you to do to overcome your sense of
meaninglessness?" There is a simple answer. "The awareness will pass.
You can forget it easily and go on living as before. But since you
want to convince yourself that you are doing something about this
flash of awareness you have had, you are recommended to return to your
former way of life, but more thoroughly and deliberately than before.
Commit yourself to doing just the kind of thing which makes further
flashes of awareness unlikely."
<p>
Here, of course, we are encountering one of those linguistic swerves
away from the point so characteristic of the evasive mind. "Authentic
being" may be used to refer to a state of dishonesty towards the facts
of existence, or to a state of dishonesty towards other people. It is
even true that the two things may be to some extent interconnected,
since a person suffering from the human evasion is clearly not able to
be honest towards anyone, if only because he is constantly trying to
force them to shield him from reality, including the reality of his
own perceptions and desires.
<p>
It should come as no surprise that existentialist writers are unable
to distinguish clearly between "mauvaise foi" towards existence and
"mauvaise foi" towards people.
<p>
And so this kind of thing is written:
<p><blockquote>
<i>Dasein</i>, everyday life, is destructible, and we should not even
desire its indefinite continuation. But <i>Existenz,</i> authentic selfhood,
can be entered into now and its meaning is imperishable. Only by facing
death realistically do we become formed, decisive, resolute, and
reconciled to finitude. The threat of missing true selfhood is worse
than the unavoidable fact of physical disintegration. And the reality
of the latter makes me alert to the former. It is because I am going
to die as a biological organism that I may miss true self-hood. Because
I do not have forever, the question hangs over every moment: 'Are you
living, feeling, realizing, choosing yourself or some feeble caricature
of what you could be?' One who has lived for ends-in-themselves and who
has entered into existential communication with others knows that what
is important in his life and in the life of his friend cannot be
annihilated by death.<a href="6.htm#6.5">[5]</a></blockquote>
<p>
What can be said of the statement that we can enter "authentic"
selfhood "now"? Existential flashes are not easily had to order. It is
not even easy, by trying, to realize vividly the fact that you are
going to die.
<p>
Even more dubious is the assertion that once you have entered this
state "its meaning is imperishable". Can this mean "you will be able
to remain in constant awareness of the unknowability of existence", or
even "once you have been fully aware of existence your psychology will
never be the same again"? Such psychological evidence we have would
seem to indicate that existential awareness is usually momentary, and
its permanent effects on a sane person are nil.
<p>
Our existentialist now tells us that "only by facing death realistically
do we become ... reconciled to finitude". To be aware of one's finiteness
is one thing; to be reconciled to it is quite another. Nearly everyone
seems to manage to be reconciled without being aware; I should have thought
it probable that anyone who was fully aware of it would find it
intolerable.
