# deoxy.org-mirror

building the most complete deoxy.org mirror possible...


## README

This repo is intended to be the most complete Deoxy.org mirror that can be cobbled together from many different mirror sites. There are missing scripts, files, etc. but the goal is to build the most complete site possible from right before website author dimitri took Deoxy.org off the Internet. Feel free to download and host but try to keep it as pristine as possible.

Deoxy.org started in the late 1990's and was a bastion for alternative thought, culture, and expression. Many of the topics posted by dimitri were very clairvoyant and timeless. Sometime in 2016(?) the site disappeared from the Internet for reasons only dimitri would know.

Deoxy.org was a big inspiration to me and help formulate a lot of my current thinking. As a way to pay it forward I wanted to find a way to pay homage. Over the years I found many fellow Internet souls that mirrored Deoxy.org during various time periods and I started a small collection of them. Some have been donations and others were scraped.

I welcome collaboration if you have any of the missing files we would need to create the best mirror possible.

I want to thank fellow psychonauts for your donations and say thank you to dimitri for all the hard work he/she/they did over the years.
