<h1>Chapter 4:
<br><small>Circuits Five Through Eight: Continuing Evolution</small></h1>

   Note: <em>The following description of the circuits is a somewhat
paraphrased summary of <a href="8circuit.htm#c5">Robert Anton Wilson's material on the upper four circuits</a> from his Prometheus Rising (Falcon Press, 1983).
Quotes from Lao Tsu are from the Vintage Books Tao Te Ching,
translated by Gia-fu Feng and Jane English; Zen parables are from
Paul Reps' Zen Flesh, Zen Bones.  The day-to-day applications are
my own.
<p>
   While Circuits One through Four are present and operative in
every adult human, activation of the next four circuits is not
nearly as widespread.  In some, none of these circuits may have
ever been accessed, while others may occasionally have experiences
of one or more of the upper circuits.  In any case, as Circuits
Five through Eight represent newly emerging evolutionary trends,
they are at present operative only in a relatively small
percentage of the population.  The CyberNaut seeks to increase
that percentage.</em>
<h3>
Circuit Five: The Holistic Neurosomatic Circuit
</h3>
   This circuit is typified by ecstatic or blissful feelings,
sensory enhancement, sensual pleasure from even ordinary
experiences and activities, and a generally blissful, laid-back
'high' of contentment with the state of things in general.
Gurdjieff referred to this circuit as the True Magnetic Center.
Triggering devices include isolation tanks, the Hindu technique of
pranayama, or controlled breathing, zero-gravity environments,
and, for the adventurous, Cannabis drugs.  Such experiences as
spontaneous regeneration or 'faith healing,' feelings of eternal
youthfulness, and rapturous acceptance of others/events involve at
least a temporary activation of this circuit. Circuit Five control
techniques have been employed by yogic and <a href="hs_tant.htm">Tantric practices</a>, <a href="w_lectur.htm">Zen</a>, ancient Greek psychedelic drug-assisted rituals at <a href="def/em.htm">Eleusis</a>, Dionysians, Mithraic cults, Christian Scientists, Sufis,and
probably early Christianity as well.  Occasionally attempts to
activate Circuit Five will result in a temporary, although
disconcerting, period known as the 'Dark Night of the Soul' or
'crossing the Abyss,' characterized by painful ordinary physical
sensations, generalized bodily discomfort, distorted, nightmarish
perceptions, anxiety, and an aversion to or fear of light.
However difficult such a state may become, it does pass eventually
into the ecstatic bliss of positive Circuit Five experience.
<p>
   The fifth circuit, centered largely in the right cortex,
'thinks in Gestalts' -- that is, fifth-circuit processes are not
linear progressions but holistic, simultaneous perceptions.
Neurologically wired to the genitals and the limbic system
(associated with the first circuit) and often working through
endorphins, the circuit is often triggered by relaxed, playful
sex.  One who has activated and imprinted this circuit is radiant,
cheerful rather than depressed, energetic rather than sluggish, in
exceptional health, and almost seems to 'sparkle.'  The various
complaints of the lower circuits -- first-circuit physical
sickness, second-circuit aggressive power-over, submissive
no-power, and the associated turbulent emotions, third-circuit
bewilderment over how to improve the quality of life, and
fourth-circuit guilt -- are resolved quickly and dramatically by
the advent of fifth-circuit consciousness.  An accurate
description of life by fifth-circuit adepts is 'floating one foot
off the ground.'
<h4>
Circuit Five Application
</h4>
   It seems to me that one of the most effective ways to integrate
Circuit Five experience into daily life is to work on focusing the
consciousness intensely in space-time.  Being 'here-now'
transforms even the most mundane tasks into a set of hedonic
sensations and virtually wipes out boredom from the working
vocabulary.  Paul Reps relates such an ancient tale in his Zen
Flesh, Zen Bones:
<blockquote>
     Zen students are with their masters at least ten years before
     they presume to teach others.  Nan-in was visited by Tenno,
     who, having passed his apprenticeship, had become a teacher.
     The day happened to be rainy, so Tenno wore wooden clogs and
     carried an umbrella.  After greeting him Nan-in remarked:
<p>
     'I suppose you left your wooden clogs in the vestibule.  I
     want to know if your umbrella is on the right or left side of
     the clogs.' Tenno, confused, had no instant answer.  He
     realized that he was unable to carry his Zen every minute.
     He became Nan-in's pupil, and he studied six more years to
     accomplish his every-minute Zen.
</blockquote>
   When this Circuit Five 'every-minute Zen' is achieved, one
can't help remembering where the umbrella is!  At the moment that
he placed the umbrella, Tenno would have been so absorbed in the
interplay of colors and shapes between the umbrella, clogs, and
the decor of the vestibule, for instance, that those sensory
images would have been vividly stamped in his mind and readily
accessible to memory.  In this state, the environment becomes a
whirling miasma of such vivid sense data that just walking down
the sidewalk becomes a 'retinal circus': the texture of the
sidewalk is a profound sculpture of perfect randomness; the sprays
of grass coming up through the cracks are delightful explosions of
soft green against the tan concrete; wildflowers along the sides
smear their luscious pastels across the visual field, seeming to
blossom into the brain itself; trees a few feet away leap into the
mind with every gully and protrusion in the bark relieved in vast
detail; the blocks in the sidewalk seem crazily tilted and
hilariously three-dimensional; the sudden whooshing of a sprinkler
in the adjacent yard seems a delicately balanced symphony of
sound; the sky is impossibly blue against the wispy clouds -- the
whole body tingles and lightens, seeming about to lift off the
ground and fly!  Needless to say, life becomes a fluid, hedonic
experience in which boredom is unheard of.
<p>
   But what about when your bank screws you over, your camping
trip gets rained out, your car throws a rod, and your best friend
announces she is no longer speaking to you?  No amount of cursing
the local deities and trying to force things into your elegantly
prepared scheme will do a bit of good.  With that approach, you
stomp around the house muttering all day until you've muttered
yourself blue in the face.  At such times the most expedient thing
to do is to stop in your tracks, screw your eyes tight shut
(assuming you're not driving), jump up and down, screaming madly a
few times, then do some deep breathing until you feel relatively
stable.  Hopefully, during the course of the breathing your face
(and other muscles) will have relaxed somewhat.  Now, you can open
your eyes to a calmer world and proceed to plan your next step.
<p>
   First priority must be relieving any physical pain you may be
in, if the means are at hand, so that you can think more clearly.
Slow down, tense and relax all of your muscles in turn; breathe
deeply and slowly, filling your lungs and expanding your abdomen
with air; hold for a few moments, then release, still slowly,
pausing with all of the air released before inhaling again.
Meanwhile, slowly tell yourself 'Calm, calm, calm,' lingering on
each sound within the word as you breathe.  Now, take stock of
your situation. Exactly what has changed, and what are the
immediate implications for you? Never mind futuring; many possible
complications may never develop.  Accept complete responsibility
for your perceptions!  The importance of the last sentence cannot
be emphasized enough.  Through experience I have found that
usually a problem isn't a problem unless you perceive it as one.
If all else fails, a simple shrug and a decision to go with the
flow, to do whatever is necessary and try to learn from the
situation, seems to be the best approach. Struggling against the
reality bumping you in the nose accomplishes nothing and is
extremely frustrating, to say the least.
<blockquote>
        As Lao Tsu said,<br>
        It is not wise to rush about....<bR>
        If too much energy is used, exhaustion follows.<bR>
                 ....<br>
        The world is ruled by letting things take their course.<bR>
        It cannot be ruled by interfering.<br>
                      --Tao Te Ching
</blockquote>
Finally, yet another hint from a Zen parable:
<p>
Buddha told a man in a sutra:
<blockquote>
     A man traveling across a field encountered a tiger. He fled,
     the tiger after him.  Coming to a precipice, he caught hold
     of the root of a wild vine and swung himself down over the
     edge.  The tiger sniffed at him from above.  Trembling, the
     man looked down to where, far below, another tiger was
     waiting to eat him. Only the vine sustained him.
<p>
     Two mice, one white and one black, little by little started
     gnaw away the vine.  The man saw a luscious strawberry near
     him.  Grasping the vine with one hand, he plucked the
     strawberry with the other.  How sweet it tasted!
</blockquote>

<h3>Circuit Six: The Collective Neurogenetic Circuit</h3>
   Circuit Six is operating when the information archived in our
DNA becomes consciously accessible in the waking state.  The RNA-DNA 'dialogue' begins broadcasting messages to the central nervous
system from within each neuron. Descriptions of experiences of
this circuit typically include 'past-life memories,'
reincarnational themes, concepts of immortality, the idea of
akashic records, or a realization of something like the Gaia
hypothesis, which views our entire planet as a conscious organism,
with all life upon it inextricably linked.  The music of Beethoven
paints quite an accurate picture of this realization; large doses
of LSD inevitably trigger a temporary similar awareness.
Gurdjieff called this circuit the True Emotional Center.
<p>
   Various cultures have given different names to sixth-circuit
states throughout the ages -- Hindu 'Atman consciousness,' Greek
'vision of Pan,' Chinese idea of the Tao, etc.  When Circuit Six
is initially activated, personified archetypes usually arrive in
the personal philosophy, interpreted as 'Gods,' 'Goddesses,'
and/or 'Demons.' Jung's theory of archetypes from the collective
unconscious describes this phenomenon well.  These archetypes
commonly appear in the world of dreams; they become more immediate
still when Circuit Six is flipped on, often humanizing the circuit
as an image of the 'Higher Self' such as the cosmic Fool, the Holy
Guardian Angel, dwarves, the Green Man, etc.  If the circuit
remains activated, the perceptions usually move into more direct
visions of a consciously evolving, unfolding evolutionary scheme
of increasing self-awareness, including awareness of the entire
Gaia biosphere, past developments and future possibilities alike.
Death is no longer to be feared, since not a single life but a
continuous framework of lives and deaths becomes the operating
reality.
<p>
   Circuit Six processes, probably operating from the right neo-cortex, use the many-layered language of endless associations and
connotations conjured up by each concept -- language similar to
that used by James Joyce in his Finnegans Wake.  When a plethora
of synchronicities emerges in daily life, the sixth circuit is
definitely alive and well, mirroring this language of simultaneous
concepts in everyday events.
<p>
   The basic experience of Circuit Six is communion or
conversation with the ancient genetic 'architect' behind all
physical organisms.  Whether personified as a divinely intoxicated
male or female archetype or defined as an impersonal, amorphous
force, the realization is that of a vast life force becoming
increasingly self-aware and exploring the infinite possibilities
that lie ahead.
<h4>
Circuit Six Application
</h4>
   Enmeshing Circuit Six consciousness into your everyday format
can be quite an adventure!  First of all, we'll consider working
with the genetic archetypes.  The most useful application of these
archetypes, in an everyday sort of way, seems to be the practice
of 'aspecting' or 'drawing down,' 'invoking a god(dess)-form,'
etc.  Let's say you're on your way to deliver a particularly
complex presentation, and you're understandably jittery.  Take a
minute or two to select an appropriate archetype or assemble your
own from the genetic archives, then construct a brief, empowering
fantasy in which you, as the archetype, demonstrate your
eloquence, your balance, your unruffled assurance, or whatever
else it is you need for this particular occasion.
<p>
   In this instance, you might select Connor MacLeod from the
movie Highlander to impress dynamic, determined poise and
confidence -- for the next few minutes, you might feel the
ancient sword in your hands like the touch of an old friend, feel
the power and excitement of the Quickening--feel the relaxed
alertness as you circle your foe, feel the empty space at the
center of the peace as you act effortlessly and fluidly, every
nerve tingling to the same pulse--feel the
quantum-leap-spiralling-upwards zoom as the power of
self-actualization explodes into you -- as you claim the Prize.
(Fade to black....)  Now you speed on winged boots through memory
circuitry, tangled neural gardens, finding the best words, the
most effective gestures, just the right degree of enthusiasm to
come out shining....  Now you play the Concertmaster, bringing in
each element of a magnificent dawn just at the right time with the
perfect dance of your baton, while the sky lightens, animals stir,
buds open and the surface looks up in unison as the sun appears
over the horizon....  I bet you're a lot less jittery now.  Good
luck!
<p>
   In addition to archetypal fantasy, Circuit Six has other
advantageous uses--namely, peeping at the genetic blueprints for
'future' possibilities. At the very least, such excursions will
expand your perspective and serve to remind you that nothing is
static--that we are not at the end of an evolutionary trend but
are constantly designing new pathways into the 'future.'  After
contemplating some of the eye-opening realities we can look
forward to cultivating, it's often a lot easier to appreciate our
current position in the Universing of our choice.
<h3>
Circuit Seven: The Metaprogramming Circuit
</h3>
   The Metaprogramming Circuit is activated when the brain becomes
aware of itself as engineer of experience.  When you think of your
mind as mind, then think of the mind that contemplates that mind
as mind, then think of the mind that thinks of the mind
contemplating mind as mind, you have discovered the path to
metaprogramming consciousness.  Most methods of 'enlightenment'
function by leading the student around and around in circles until
he is struck by the realization that he is himself responsible for
everything he experiences.  With the aid of this circuit, one
becomes self-programmer, then programs the self-programming, then
programs the programming of the self-programming, etc.--cybernetic
consciousness has been attained. Suddenly one is struck by the
humorous, completely relative nature of all third-circuit reality
maps; rigid, dogmatic systems claiming to have the only 'One True
Way' become cosmic jokes to be laughed at heartily.  The Grand
Game becomes visible all at once; creating your own rules,
changing them at will, even manufacturing different gameboards for
entertainment and edification is what Circuit Seven is all about.
<p>
   Apparently operating from the frontal lobes, the
metaprogramming circuit has been called the Gnostic 'soul,' the
Chinese 'no-mind' (wu-hsin), the Tibetan Buddhist White Light of
the Void, the Hindu Shiva-darshana, Gurdjieff's True Intellectual
Center.  When you ultimately realize that the 'self' is not
constant but constantly shifting and that the 'soul' (Circuit
Seven) has no form precisely because it dons all forms and sheds
them at will, playing every role conceivable--you find you have
entered a Strange Loop no less perplexing, dramatic, and funny as
a Zen koan.  All that remains to be done is to constantly figure
out new ways to create reality-maps that are even funnier,
sexier, more inclusive, more delightful, and more entertaining
than the ones you were using yesterday!
<h4>
Circuit Seven Application
</h4>
   There doesn't seem to be a whole lot one can say about applying
Circuit Seven day-to-day, due to the nature of the circuit itself;
the application in this case is discovering and remembering that
as you watch Universe Universing itself, you are seeing your own
circuitry in action.  Once realized, this discovery frees you to
adopt any metaphors you wish or none at all, to drop them at will,
to pick useful elements from each reality-map and to discard non-functional ones immediately.  The possibilities from this point are endless.  With the staggering realization of total self-responsibility and self-determination comes the creative tension needed to construct, edit, and destroy new worldviews for fun and profit.  There is much to be learned by dispensing with reality-
maps entirely, if only for limited periods of time.  As Lao Tsu knew,
<blockquote>
     In the pursuit of learning, every day something is acquired.<br>
     In the pursuit  of Tao, every day something is dropped.
<p>
     And, from the Zen tradition:<br>
     Nan-in, a Japanese master during the Meiji era, received a<br>
     university professor who came to inquire about Zen.
<p>
     Nan-in served tea.  He poured his visitor's cup<br>
     full, and then kept on pouring.
<p>
     The professor watched the overflow until he no<br>
     longer could restrain himself.  'It is overfull.<br>
     No more will go in!'
<p>
     'Like this cup,' Nan-in said, 'you are full of<br>
     your own opinions and speculations.  How can I<br>
     show you Zen unless you first empty your cup?'<br>
                       -- Zen Flesh, Zen Bones
</blockquote>
   Such a refresher course in objectivity can, of course, be quite
startling -- if there is one thing that can be reliably expected
from experimentation with this circuit, it is the element of
surprise.  Situational ethics, relativity, and agnosticism are
useful tools indeed; the CyberNaut makes good use of them.
<h3>
Circuit Eight: The Non-Local Quantum Circuit
</h3>
   Also called the Metaphysiological Circuit, this type of
consciousness involves recognizing the model as a model and
proceeding to escape the model itself.  For instance, the circuits
we have been discussing theoretically are based in the brain;
however, in out-of-body experiences (OOBE's), consciousness
appears to escape the confines of the nervous system completely
and operate independently of it.  The OOBE -- sometimes triggered
by very large doses of LSD or ketamine, various yogic practices,
shamanic techniques, and sometimes occuring spontaneously -- is
one of many liberation-of-consciousness phenomena which point
ultimately to the type of experience variously known as union with
all consciousness, communion with the Cosmic Mind, Oneness with
God, etc.
<p>
   Circuit Eight experience may best be explained by Bell's
Theorem, which demonstrates the impossibility of isolated systems
in a universe where each and every particle is constantly in
'instantaneous' communication with every other. 'The Whole System
is a Whole System,' in other words.  However, Special Relativity
says that energy cannot travel faster than light, so what medium
carries this 'instantaneous' communication?  Dr. Edward Harris
Walker says it is 'consciousness'; Dr. Jack Sarfatti states that
it is 'information' and explains his theory with the following
metaphor: If the whole universe can be likened to a mega-computer,
then the sub-quantum realm is composed of mini-mini-computers.
The hardware of each computer (universe, individual brain,
sub-quantum mechanisms, etc.) is local in space and time.
However, the software is non-local, both spatially and temporally.
Since information is not energy but is what orders energy, there
is no conflict with Special Relativity.
<p>
   In any case, encounters of the Ultimate kind seem practically
beyond description.  Words appear completely inadequate; in
Wilson's opinion, perhaps Beethoven said it best of all in the
fourth movement to his Ninth Symphony.
<h4>
Circuit Eight Application
</h4>
   Language typically proves inadequate for describing non-local
phenomena, but there are some helpful methods of viewing Universe
through a non-local perspective.  One most rewarding technique is
focusing first on one's own heartbeat, then expanding the focus to
include a similar heart or pulse beating in unison within every
human heart, every animal heart, then merging with the pulsings of
plant life, and so on down to the slow, thunderous pulse of the
earth itself and out as far into the cosmos as imaginable, linking
with other planets, stars, quasars, etc.  The scope of the
imagination is the only limiting factor.  This exercise, performed
often and vividly, is a great way to feel connectedness with
Universe.  Empathy seems to be a vital key to opening up Circuit
Eight; therefore, exercises involving perceiving events/emotions
simultaneously from the vantage points of several different people
at once are highly useful. As links are forged more readily
between people who share an intimate bond, reverent sex is an
excellent opportunity for expanding the awareness to include
multiple sensations.
<p>
   Since Circuit Eight is non-local in time as well as in space,
such time-bridging abilities as precognition and retrocognition
come into play.  Often, precognition is a matter of trusting your
own perceptions more than anything else, rather than dismissing
them as 'only' imagination or fantasy.  Indeed, neither the future
nor the past can be described as fixed, since each person's
reality differs so widely, and many possibilities in the running
may or may not materialize at any given point.  With activation of
this circuit, comes the increasing awareness that various
realities are more or less arbitrary and equally valid depending
on the framework being used, a logical progression from the
metaprogramming discoveries of Circuit Seven.  Finally, the most
obvious indicator of Circuit Eight in operation is an expansive,
'cosmic' feeling that defies description but feels utterly
marvelous.
<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>
   The CyberNaut's goal must be to permanently activate and
incorporate each of the upper four circuits into everyday life.
These expanded modes of consciousness can and should work with the
realization of interconnectedness and relativity of all
mindschemes to produce a greater satisfaction with life and a
greater sense of humor towards the playing of The Game.  Once
these circuits are in healthy operation, every moment becomes a
dizzying spiral of intoxication with life and a creative endeavor
to conjure even more fun from the ever-unfolding processes at
work.
