<P>
The experiences resulting from the use of psychedelic drugs are
often described in religious terms. They are therefore of interest
to those like myself who, in the tradition of William James,<A HREF="w_psyrel.htm#footnote1" NAME="back1"><font size="-2"><sup>1</sup></font></A> are concerned with the psychology of religion. For more than thirty years I have been studying the causes, the consequences, and the conditions of those peculiar states of consciousness in which the individual discovers himself to be one continuous process with God, with the Universe, with the Ground of Being, or whatever
name he may use by cultural conditioning or personal preference
for the ultimate and eternal reality. We have no satisfactory
and definitive name for experiences of this kind. The terms "religious
experience," "mystical experience," and "cosmic consciousness" are all too vague and comprehensive to denote that specific mode of consciousness which, to those who have known it, is as real and overwhelming as falling in love. This article describes such states of consciousness induced by psychedelic
drugs, although they are virtually indistinguishable from genuine
mystical experience. The article then discusses objections to
the use of psychedelic drugs that arise mainly from the opposition
between mystical values and the traditional religious and secular
values of Western society.
<H2><a name="part1">The Psychedelic Experience</a></H2>
<P>
The idea of mystical experiences resulting from drug use is not
readily accepted in Western societies. Western culture has, historically,
a particular fascination with the value and virtue of man as an
individual, self-determining, responsible ego, controlling himself
and his world by the power of conscious effort and will. Nothing,
then, could be more repugnant to this cultural tradition than
the notion of spiritual or psychological growth through the use
of drugs. A "drugged" person is by definition dimmed
in consciousness, fogged in judgment, and deprived of will. But
not all psychotropic (consciousness-changing) chemicals are narcotic
and soporific, as are alcohol, opiates, and barbiturates. The
effects of what are now called psychedelic (mind-manifesting)
chemicals differ from those of alcohol as laughter differs from
rage, or delight from depression. There is really no analogy between
being "high" on LSD and "drunk" on bourbon. True, no one in either state should drive a car, but neither should one drive while reading a book, playing a violin, or making love. Certain creative activities and states of mind demand a concentration and devotion that are simply incompatible with piloting a death-dealing engine along a highway.
<P>
I myself have experimented with five of the principal psychedelics:
<a href="l_impgui.htm">LSD-25</a>, mescaline, psilocybin, dimethyl-tryptamine (<a href="dmt.htm">DMT</a>), and
cannabis. I have done so, as William James tried nitrous oxide,
to see if they could help me in identifying what might be called
the "essential" or "active" ingredients of the mystical experience. For almost all the classical literature on mysticism is vague, not only in describing the experience, but also in showing rational connections between the experience
itself and the various traditional methods recommended to induce
it: fasting, concentration, breathing exercises, prayers, incantations,
and dances. A traditional master of Zen or Yoga, when asked why
such-and-such practices lead or predispose one to the mystical
experience, always responds, "This is the way my teacher
gave it to me. This is the way I found out. If you're seriously
interested, try it for yourself." This answer hardly satisfies
an impertinent, scientifically minded, and intellectually curious
Westerner. It reminds him of archaic medical prescriptions compounding
five salamanders, powdered gallows rope, three boiled bats, a
scruple of phosphorus, three pinches of henbane, and a dollop
of dragon dung dropped when the moon was in Pisces. Maybe it worked,
but what was the essential ingredient?
<P>
It struck me, therefore, that if any of the psychedelic chemicals
would in fact predispose my consciousness to the mystical experience,
I could use them as instruments for studying and describing that
experience as one uses a microscope for bacteriology, even though
the microscope is an "artificial" and "unnatural"
contrivance which might be said to "distort" the vision
of the naked eye. However, when I was first invited to test the
mystical qualities of LSD-25 by Dr. Keith Ditman of the Neuropsychiatric
Clinic at UCLA Medical School, I was unwilling to believe that
any mere chemical could induce a genuine mystical experience.
At most, it might bring about a state of spiritual insight analogous
to swimming with water wings. Indeed, my first experiment with
LSD-25 was not mystical. It was an intensely interesting aesthetic
and intellectual experience that challenged my powers of analysis
and careful description to the utmost.
<P>
Some months later, in 1959, I tried LSD-25 again with Drs. Sterling
Bunnell and Michael Agron, who were then associated with the Langley-Porter
Clinic, in San Francisco. In the course of two experiments I was
amazed and somewhat embarrassed to find myself going through states
of consciousness that corresponded precisely with every description
of major mystical experiences that I had ever read.<A HREF="w_psyrel.htm#footnote2" NAME="back2"><font size="-2"><sup>2</sup></font></A> Furthermore, they exceeded both in depth and in a peculiar quality of unexpectedness the three "natural and spontaneous" experiences of this kind that had happened to me in previous years.
<P>
Through subsequent experimentation with LSD-25 and the other chemicals
named above (with the exception of DMT, which I find amusing but
relatively uninteresting), I found I could move with ease into
the state of "cosmic consciousness," and in due course
became less and less dependent on the chemicals themselves for
"tuning in" to this particular wave length of experience.
Of the five psychedelics tried, I found that LSD-25 and cannabis
suited my purposes best. Of these two, the latter&#151;cannabis&#151;which
I had to use abroad in countries where it is not outlawed, proved
to be the better. It does not induce bizarre alterations of sensory
perception, and medical studies indicate that it may not, save
in great excess, have the dangerous side effects of LSD.
<P>
For the purposes of this study, in describing my experiences with
psychedelic drugs I avoid the occasional and incidental bizarre
alterations of sense perception that psychedelic chemicals may
induce. I am concerned, rather, with the fundamental alterations
of the normal, socially induced consciousness of one's own existence
and relation to the external world. I am trying to delineate the
basic principles of psychedelic awareness. But I must add that
I can speak only for myself. The quality of these experiences
depends considerably upon one's prior orientation and attitude
to life, although the now voluminous descriptive literature of
these experiences accords quite remarkably with my own.
<P>
Almost invariably, my experiments with psychedelics have had four
dominant characteristics. I shall try to explain them-in the
expectation that the reader will say, at least of the second and
third, "Why, that's obvious! No one needs a drug to see that."
Quite so, but every insight has degrees of intensity. There can
be obvious-1 and obvious-2, and the latter comes on with shattering
clarity, manifesting its implications in every sphere and dimension
of our existence.
<P>
<b><a name="part1a">The first characteristic is a slowing down of time</a>,</b> a <em>concentration in the present</em>. One's normally compulsive concern for the future decreases, and one becomes aware of the enormous importance
and interest of what is happening at the moment. Other people,
going about their business on the streets, seem to be slightly
crazy, failing to realize that the whole point of life is to be
fully aware of it as it happens. One therefore relaxes, almost
luxuriously, into studying the colors in a glass of water, or
in listening to the now highly articulate vibration of every note
played on an oboe or sung by a voice.
<P>
From the pragmatic standpoint of our culture, such an attitude
is very bad for business. It might lead to improvidence, lack
of foresight, diminished sales of insurance policies, and abandoned
savings accounts. Yet this is just the corrective that our culture
needs. No one is more fatuously impractical than the "successful"
executive who spends his whole life absorbed in frantic paper
work with the objective of retiring in comfort at sixty-five,
when it will all be too late. Only those who have cultivated the
art of living completely in the present have any use for making
plans for the future, for when the plans mature they will be able
to enjoy the results. "Tomorrow never comes." I have
never yet heard a preacher urging his congregation to practice
that section of the Sermon on the Mount which begins, "Be
not anxious for the morrow...." The truth is that people
who live for the future are, as we say of the insane, "not
quite all there"&#151;or here: by over-eagerness they are perpetually
missing the point. Foresight is bought at the price of anxiety,
and when overused it destroys all its own advantages.
<P>
<b><a name="part1b">The second characteristic I will call <em>awareness of polarity</em>.</a></b> This is the vivid realization that states, things, and events that we ordinarily call opposite are interdependent, like back
and front, or the poles of a magnet. By polar awareness one sees
that things which are explicitly different are implicitly one:
self and other, subject and object, left and right, male and female-and
then, a little more surprisingly, solid and space, figure and
background, pulse and interval, saints and sinners, police and
criminals, in-groups and out-groups. Each is definable only in
terms of the other, and they go together transactionally, like
buying and selling, for there is no sale without a purchase, and
no purchase without a sale. As this awareness becomes increasingly
intense, you feel that you yourself are polarized with the external
universe in such a way that you imply each other. Your push is
its pull, and its push is your pull&#151;as when you move the steering
wheel of a car. Are you pushing it or pulling it?
<P>
At first, this is a very odd sensation, not unlike hearing your
own voice played back to you on an electronic system immediately
after you have spoken. You become confused, and wait for <em>it</em>
to go on! Similarly, you feel that you are something being done
by the universe, yet that the universe is equally something being
done by you-which is true, at least in the neurological sense
that the peculiar structure of our brains translates the sun into
light, and air vibrations into sound. Our normal sensation of
relationship to the outside world is that sometimes I push it,
and sometimes it pushes me. But if the two are actually one, where
does action begin and responsibility rest? If the universe is
doing me, how can I be sure that, two seconds hence, I will still
remember the English language? If I am doing it, how can I be
sure that, two seconds hence, my brain will know how to turn the
sun into light? From such unfamiliar sensations as these, the
psychedelic experience can generate confusion, paranoia, and terror-even
though the individual is feeling his relationship to the world
exactly as it would be described by a biologist, ecologist, or
physicist, for he is feeling himself as the unified field of organism
and environment.
<P>
<b><a name="part1c">The third characteristic, arising from the second, is <em>awareness of relativity</em>.</a></b> I see that I am a link in an infinite hierarchy of processes and beings, ranging from molecules through bacteria 
and insects to human beings, and, maybe, to angels and gods-a
hierarchy in which every level is in effect the same situation.
For example, the poor man worries about money while the rich man
worries about his health: the worry is the same, but the difference
is in its substance or dimension. I realize that fruit flies must
think of themselves as people, because, like ourselves, they find
themselves in the middle of their own world-with immeasurably
greater things above and smaller things below. To us, they all
look alike and seem to have no personality-as do the Chinese when
we have not lived among them. Yet fruit flies must see just as
many subtle distinctions among themselves as we among ourselves.
<P>
From this it is but a short step to the realization that all forms
of life and being are simply variations on a single theme: we
are all in fact one being doing the same thing in as many different
ways as possible. As the French proverb goes, <em>plus ca change,
plus c'est la meme chose</em> (the more it varies, the more it
is one). I see, further, that feeling threatened by the inevitability
of death is really the same experience as feeling alive, and that
as all beings are feeling this everywhere, they are all just as
much "I" as myself. Yet the "I" feeling, to be felt at all, must always be a sensation relative to the "other"-to something beyond its control and experience. To be at all, it must begin and end. But the intellectual jump that mystical and psychedelic experiences make here is in enabling you to see that
all these myriad I-centers are yourself&#151;not, indeed, your personal
and superficially conscious ego, but what Hindus call the <em>paramatman</em>,
the Self of all selves.<A HREF="w_psyrel.htm#footnote3" NAME="back3"><font size="-2"><sup>3</sup></font></A> As
the retina enables us to see countless pulses of energy as a single
light, so the mystical experience shows us innumerable individuals
as a single Self.
<P>
<b><a name="part1d">The fourth characteristic is <em>awareness of eternal energy</em>,</a></b> often in the form of intense white light, which seems to be both the current in your nerves and that mysterious e which equals 
mc2. This may sound like megalomania or delusion of grandeur-but
one sees quite clearly that all existence is a single energy,
and that this energy is one's own being. Of course there is death
as well as life, because energy is a pulsation, and just as waves
must have both crests and troughs, the experience of existing
must go on and off. Basically, therefore, there is simply nothing
to worry about, because you yourself are the eternal energy of
the universe playing hide-and-seek (off-and-on) with itself.
At root, you are the Godhead, for God is all that there is. Quoting
Isaiah just a little out of context: "I am the Lord, and
there is none else. I form the light and create the darkness:
I make peace, and create evil. I, the Lord, do all these things."<A HREF="w_psyrel.htm#footnote4" NAME="back4"><font size="-2"><sup>4</sup></font></A> This is the sense
of the fundamental tenet of Hinduism, <em>Tat tram asi</em>&#151;"THAT
(i.e., "that subtle Being of which this whole universe is
composed") art thou."<A HREF="w_psyrel.htm#footnote5" NAME="back5"><font size="-2"><sup>5</sup></font></A> 
A classical case of this experience, from the
West, is in Tennyson's Memoirs:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A kind of waking trance I have frequently had, quite up from boyhood,
when I have been all alone. This has generally come upon me thro'
repeating my own name two or three times to myself silently, till
all at once, as it were out of the intensity of the consciousness
of individuality, the individuality itself seemed to dissolve
and fade away into boundless being, and this not a confused state,
but the clearest of the clearest, the surest of the surest, the
weirdest of the weirdest, utterly beyond words, where death was
an almost laughable impossibility, the loss of personality (if
so it were) seeming no extinction but the only true life.<A HREF="w_psyrel.htm#footnote6" NAME="back6"><font size="-2"><sup>6</sup></font></A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Obviously, these characteristics of the psychedelic
experience, as I have known it, are aspects of a single state
of consciousness&#151;for I have been describing the same thing from
different angles. The descriptions attempt to convey the reality
of the experience, but in doing so they also suggest some of the
inconsistencies between such experience and the current values
of society.
<H2><a name="part2">Opposition to Psychedelic Drugs</a></H2>
<P>
Resistance to allowing use of psychedelic drugs originates in
both religious and secular values. The difficulty in describing
psychedelic experiences in traditional religious terms suggests
one ground of opposition. The Westerner must borrow such words
as <em>samadhi</em> or <em>moksha</em> from the Hindus, or <em>satori</em>
or <em>kensho</em> from the Japanese, to describe the experience
of oneness with the universe. We have no appropriate word because
our own Jewish and Christian theologies will not accept the idea
that man's inmost self can be identical with the Godhead, even
though Christians may insist that this was true in the unique
instance of Jesus Christ. Jews and Christians think of God in
political and monarchical terms, as the supreme governor of the
universe, the ultimate boss. Obviously, it is both socially unacceptable
and logically preposterous for a particular individual to claim
that he, in person, is the omnipotent and omniscient ruler of
the world-to be accorded suitable recognition and honor.
<P>
Such an imperial and kingly concept of the ultimate reality, however,
is neither necessary nor universal. The Hindus and the Chinese
have no difficulty in conceiving of an identity of the self and
the Godhead. For most Asians, other than Muslims, the Godhead
moves and manifests the world in much the same way that a centipede
manipulates a hundred legs-spontaneously, without deliberation
or calculation. In other words, they conceive the universe by
analogy with an organism as distinct from a mechanism. They do
not see it as an artifact or construct under the conscious direction
of some supreme technician, engineer, or architect.
<P>
If, however, in the context of Christian or Jewish tradition,
an individual declares himself to be one with God, he must be
dubbed blasphemous (subversive) or insane. Such a mystical experience
is a clear threat to traditional religious concepts. The Judaeo-Christian
tradition has a monarchical image of God, and monarchs, who rule
by force, fear nothing more than insubordination. The Church has
therefore always been highly suspicious of mystics, because they
seem to be insubordinate and to claim equality or, worse, identity
with God. For this reason, John Scotus Erigena and Meister Eckhart
were condemned as heretics. This was also why the Quakers faced
opposition for their doctrine of the Inward Light, and for their
refusal to remove hats in church and in court. A few occasional
mystics may be all right so long as they watch their language,
like St. Teresa of Avila and St. John of the Cross, who maintained,
shall we say, a metaphysical distance of respect between themselves
and their heavenly King. Nothing, however, could be more alarming
to the ecclesiastical hierarchy than a popular outbreak of mysticism,
for this might well amount to setting up a democracy in the kingdom
of heaven-and such alarm would be shared equally by Catholics,
Jews, and fundamentalist Protestants.
<P>
The monarchical image of God, with its implicit distaste for religious
insubordination, has a more pervasive impact than many Christians
might admit. The thrones of kings have walls immediately behind
them, and all who present themselves at court must prostrate themselves
or kneel, because this is an awkward position from which to make
a sudden attack. It has perhaps never occurred to Christians that
when they design a church on the model of a royal court (basilica)
and prescribe church ritual, they are implying that God, like
a human monarch, is afraid. This is also implied by flattery in
prayers:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
O Lord our heavenly Father, high and mighty, King of kings, Lord
of lords, the only Ruler of princes, who dost from thy throne
behold all the dwellers upon earth: most heartily we beseech thee
with thy favor to behold....<A HREF="w_psyrel.htm#footnote7" NAME="back7"><font size="-2"><sup>7</sup></font></A> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The Western man who claims consciousness of oneness
with God or the universe thus clashes with his society's concept
of religion. In most Asian cultures, however, such a man will
be congratulated as having penetrated the true secret of life.
He has arrived, by chance or by some such discipline as Yoga or
Zen meditation, at a state of consciousness in which he experiences
directly and vividly what our own scientists know to be true in
theory. For the ecologist, the biologist, and the physicist know
(but seldom feel) that every organism constitutes a single field
of behavior, or process, with its environment. There is no way
of separating what any given organism is doing from what its environment
is doing, for which reason ecologists speak not of organisms in
environments but of organism-environments. Thus the words "I"
and "self" should properly mean what the whole universe
is doing at this particular "here-and-now" called John
Doe.
<P>
The kingly concept of God makes identity of self and God, or self
and universe, inconceivable in Western religious terms. The difference
between Eastern and Western concepts of man and his universe,
however, extends beyond strictly religious concepts. The Western
scientist may rationally perceive the idea of organism-environment,
but he does not ordinarily feel this to be true. By cultural and
social conditioning, he has been hypnotized into experiencing
himself as an ego-as an isolated center of consciousness and
will inside a bag of skin, confronting an external and alien world.
We say, "I came into this world." But we did nothing
of the kind. We came out of it in just the same way that fruit
comes out of trees. Our galaxy, our cosmos, "peoples"
in the same way that an apple tree "apples."
<P>
Such a vision of the universe clashes with the idea of a monarchical
God, with the concept of the separate ego, and even with the secular,
atheist/agnostic mentality, which derives its common sense from
the mythology of nineteenth-century scientist. According to this
view, the universe is a mindless mechanism and man a sort of accidental
microorganism infesting a minute globular rock that revolves about
an unimportant star on the outer fringe of one of the minor galaxies.
This "put-down" theory of man is extremely common among
such quasi scientists as sociologists, psychologists, and psychiatrists,
most of whom are still thinking of the world in terms of Newtonian
mechanics, and have never really caught up with the ideas of Einstein
and Bohr, Oppenheimer and Schrodinger. Thus to the ordinary institutional-type
psychiatrist, any patient who gives the least hint of mystical
or religious experience is automatically diagnosed as deranged.
From the standpoint of the mechanistic religion, he is a heretic
and is given electroshock therapy as an up-to-date form of thumbscrew
and rack. And, incidentally, it is just this kind of quasi scientist
who, as consultant to government and law-enforcement agencies,
dictates official policies on the use of psychedelic chemicals.
<P>
Inability to accept the mystic experience is more than an intellectual
handicap. Lack of awareness of the basic unity of organism and
environment is a serious and dangerous hallucination. For in a
civilization equipped with immense technological power, the sense
of alienation between man and nature leads to the use of technology
in a hostile spirit&#151;to the "conquest" of nature instead
of intelligent co-operation with nature. The result is that we
are eroding and destroying our environment, spreading Los Angelization
instead of civilization. This is the major threat overhanging
Western, technological culture, and no amount of reasoning or
doom-preaching seems to help. We simply do not respond to the
prophetic and moralizing techniques of conversion upon which Jews
and Christians have always relied. But people have an obscure
sense of what is good for them-call it "unconscious self-healing,"
"survival instinct," "positive growth potential,"
or what you will. Among the educated young there is therefore
a startling and unprecedented interest in the transformation of
human consciousness. All over the Western world publishers are
selling millions of books dealing with Yoga, Vedanta, Zen Buddhism,
and the chemical mysticism of psychedelic drugs, and I have come
to believe that the whole "hip" subculture, however
misguided in some of its manifestations, is the earnest and responsible
effort of young people to correct the self-destroying course of
industrial civilization.
<P>
The content of the mystical experience is thus inconsistent with
both the religious and secular concepts of traditional Western
thought. Moreover, mystical experiences often result in attitudes
that threaten the authority not only of established churches,
but also of secular society. Unafraid of death and deficient in
worldly ambition, those who have undergone mystical experiences
are impervious to threats and promises. Moreover, their sense
of the relativity of good and evil arouses the suspicion that
they lack both conscience and respect for law. Use of psychedelics
in the United States by a literate bourgeoisie means that an important
segment of the population is indifferent to society's traditional
rewards and sanctions.
<P>
In theory, the existence within our secular society of a group
that does not accept conventional values is consistent with our
political vision. But one of the great problems of the United
States, legally and politically, is that we have never quite had
the courage of our convictions. The Republic is founded on the
marvelously sane principle that a human community can exist and
prosper only on a basis of mutual trust. Metaphysically, the American
Revolution was a rejection of the dogma of Original Sin, which
is the notion that because you cannot trust yourself or other
people, there must be some Superior Authority to keep us all in
order. The dogma was rejected because, if it is true that we cannot
trust ourselves and others, it follows that we cannot trust the
Superior Authority which we ourselves conceive and obey, and that
the very idea of our own untrustworthiness is unreliable!
<P>
Citizens of the United States believe, or are supposed to believe,
that a republic is the best form of government. Yet vast confusion
arises from trying to be republican in politics and monarchist
in religion. How can a republic be the best form of government
if the universe, heaven, and hell are a monarchy?<A HREF="w_psyrel.htm#footnote8" NAME="back8"><font size="-2"><sup>8</sup></font></A> Thus, despite the theory of government by consent,
based upon mutual trust, the peoples of the United States retain,
from the authoritarian backgrounds of their religions or national
origins, an utterly naive faith in law as some sort of supernatural
and paternalistic power. "There ought to be a law against
it!" Our law-enforcement officers are therefore confused,
hindered, and bewildered&#151;not to mention corrupted&#151;by being asked
to enforce sumptuary laws, often of ecclesiastical origin, that
vast numbers of people have no intention of obeying and that,
in any case, are immensely difficult or simply impossible to enforce&#151;for
example, the barring of anything so undetectable as LSD-25 from
international and interstate commerce.
<P>
<a name="part2a">Finally, there are two specific objections to use of psychedelic drugs.</a> <b>First, use of these drugs may be dangerous.</b> However, every worth-while exploration is dangerous&#151;climbing mountains, testing
aircraft, rocketing into outer space, skin diving, or collecting
botanical specimens in jungles. But if you value knowledge and
the actual delight of exploration more than mere duration of uneventful
life, you are willing to take the risks. It is not really healthy
for monks to practice fasting, and it was hardly hygienic for
Jesus to get himself crucified, but these are risks taken in the
course of spiritual adventures. Today the adventurous young are
taking risks in exploring the psyche, testing their mettle at
the task just as, in times past, they have tested it&#151;more violently&#151;in
hunting, dueling, hot-rod racing, and playing football. What they
need is not prohibitions and policemen, but the most intelligent
encouragement and advice that can be found.
<P>
<b><a name="part2b">Second, drug use may be criticized as an escape from reality.</a></b> However, this criticism assumes unjustly that the mystical experiences themselves are escapist or unreal. LSD, in particular, is by no
means a soft and cushy escape from reality. It can very easily
be an experience in which you have to test your soul against all
the devils in hell. For me, it has been at times an experience
in which I was at once completely lost in the corridors of the
mind and yet relating that very lostness to the exact order of
logic and language, simultaneously very mad and very sane. But
beyond these occasional lost and insane episodes, there are the
experiences of the world as a system of total harmony and glory,
and the discipline of relating these to the order of logic and
language must somehow explain how what William Blake called that
"energy which is eternal delight" can consist with the
misery and suffering of everyday life.<A HREF="w_psyrel.htm#footnote9" NAME="back9"><font size="-2"><sup>9</sup></font></A>
<P>
The undoubted mystical and religious intent of
most users of the psychedelics, even if some of these substances
should be proved injurious to physical health, requires that their
free and responsible use be exempt from legal restraint in any
republic that maintains a constitutional separation of church
and state.<A HREF="w_psyrel.htm#footnote10" NAME="back10"><font size="-2"><sup>10</sup></font></A> To
the extent that mystical experience conforms with the tradition
of genuine religious involvement, and to the extent that psychedelics
induce that experience, users are entitled to some constitutional
protection. Also, to the extent that research in the psychology
of religion can utilize such drugs, students of the human mind
must be free to use them. Under present laws, I, as an experienced
student of the psychology of religion, can no longer pursue research
in the field. This is a barbarous restriction of spiritual and
intellectual freedom, suggesting that the legal system of the
United States is, after all, in tacit alliance with the monarchical
theory of the universe, and will, therefore, prohibit and persecute
religious ideas and practices based on an organic and unitary
vision of the universe.<A HREF="w_psyrel.htm#footnote11"><font size="-2"><sup>11</sup></font></A>

that such substances be taken by or administered to consenting
adults only. The user of cannabis, in particular, is apt to have
peculiar difficulties in establishing his "undoubted mystical
and religious intent" in court. Having committed so loathsome

assumes a repentant demeanor, which is quite inconsistent with
the sincere belief that his use of cannabis was religious. On
the other hand, if he insists unrepentantly that he looks upon
such use as a religious sacrament, many judges will declare that
they "dislike his attitude," finding it truculent and
lacking in appreciation of the gravity of the crime, and the sentence

some church or religious organization with a substantial following.
But the felonious status of cannabis is such that grave suspicion

<li><A NAME="footnote11">Amerindians belonging to the Native
American Church who employ the psychedelic peyote cactus in their
rituals, are firmly opposed to any government control of this
plant, even if they should be guaranteed the right to its use.
They feel that peyote is a natural gift of God to mankind, and
especially to natives of the land where it grows, and that no
government has a right to interfere with its use The same argument
might be made on behalf of cannabis, or the mushroom <em>Psilocybe
mexicana Heim</em>. All these things are natural plants, not processed
or synthesized drugs, and by what authority can individuals be
prevented from eating theme There is no law against eating or
growing the mushroom <em>Amanita pantherina</em>, even though it
is fatally poisonous and only experts can distinguish it from
a common edible mushroom. This case can be made even from the
standpoint of believers in the monarchical universe of Judaism
and Christianity, for it is a basic principle of both religions,
derived from Genesis, that all natural substances created by God
are inherently good, and that evil can arise only in their misuse.
Thus laws against mere possession, or even cultivation, of these
plants are in basic conflict with biblical principles. Criminal
conviction of those who employ these plants should be based on
proven misuse. "And God said 'Behold, I have given you every
herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and
