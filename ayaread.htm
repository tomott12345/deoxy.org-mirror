<h2>Ayahuasca Drinkers among the cha-ma (sp) Indians by Heinz ku-sel (sp)</h2>
<font size=1>see what i mean?</font><br>
<stong>Originally appeared in the Psychedelic Review, 1965<br>
Read from reprint in the Psychozoic Press</strong>
<p>
I lived for seven years traveling and trading in the upper Amazon region
and often heard stories about the effect of ayahuasca. Once on a long canoe
trip down the river my indian companion had chanted the song of the Goddess
of Ayahuasca. Ayahuasca, a Quechua word meaning 'vine of death' is the
collective name for various climbing tropical lianas and also designates
the tea prepared from the leaves of the vine, either by itself or in
combination with other leaves. Indians and the Mestizos alike visit the
ayahuasquero or witch-doctor when they are ailing or think they need a
general check-up, or want to make an important decision, or simply because
they feel like it. Among the scattered half-casts and natives of the swamps
and rainforests of the Ucayali region the ayahuasca cult plays a significant
role in their religious medical practices and provides them with a good deal
of entertainment. Repeatedly I heard how in a vision induced by drinking the
tea prepared from the liana the patient had perceived the specific plant
needed for his cure - had later searched and found it in the jungle and had
subsequently recovered. <em>To the enigmatic mind of the Indian ayahuasca opens
the gate to the healing properties of the forces of nature at whose mercy
he lives.

<a name="garlic"></a>
<p>
A recurrent theme whenever the natives refer to the 
results of the drug is the vision of the 'Procession of Plants,' with 
garlic, 'the king of the good plants' leading the way. Garlic, tobacco, quinine and 
oh-hey (sp), a tree latex, are at the head of a long line of friendly elf-like plants 
which, in ayahuasca visions, bow to mankind, offering their services.</em> 
[<a href="audio/garlic.ra">
Hear the italics in pseudo-RealAudio</a>]
 The Campa
Indians, sturdy fellows, who today specialize in drawing mahogany and cedar
logs for the sawmills in Iquitos undergo a purge of ayahuasca before they
enter the flooded areas of the forest to float out the logs and assemble
them into tremendous rafts. For a cure of that nature they prepare
themselves by a prolonged <a href="maoidiet.htm">diet</a>, avoiding meat, salt, alcohol 
and sugar.
<p>
Aside from the main use of the drug for curing or keeping the consumer in
good general condition, ayahuasca will, according to its users, induce
clairvoyance and may for example solve a theft or prophesy the success or
failure of a given enterprise. A man might be planning a trip to a certain
river where he knows of a good place to tap rubber, but to be sure of good
results he will consult ayahuasca first. After that, more than likely, he
will abandon the enterprise altogether and set off in another direction to
pan gold, hunt peck-oh-re (sp) or do something else. In these unhurried
hours and days I arrived at an insight into the native's fantastic beliefs
and images, the richness of which is equaled only by the growth of the
surrounding vegetation.
<p>
Their superstitions, ideas and images freely cross and recross the
borderline of reality in strangely patterned ways. Their stories have one
thing in common - man, plant and animal are one, forever woven into an
inextricable pattern of cause and effect. Later I found that ayahuasca
visions are fabrics that illustrate endless combinations of this pattern.
Man, plant and animal also passively undergo the irradiations of each
other. Irradiations of powers that to  us are mostly non-existent. Somehow
sometimes they even acquire each other's characteristics. Once, while
drifting in a canoe the Campa indian with me disturbed the silence by
imitating the voice of the kuto-mono (sp), a copper colored monkey. A
kuto-mono from the shore answered him, a third joined in. After a while
the whole whole shoreline seems to come alive with kuto-monos. The natives
use this abliity to imitate voices to such a degree that hunting takes on
the character of treacherous assasination. Though hardly in the way of an
equivalent, the animal world puts out a bird that I heard one night on the
pa-cha-tey-ah (sp) River. It filled the darkness with an ascending scale
of glass clear notes. Quite likely it is a beautiful scale but nevertheless
it resembles the hysterical laughter of an insane women. It shocked me. I
felt upset, mocked, laughed at.
<p>
Everything calls in the jungle. Once a Campa indian in my boat when we were
drifting far from the shore was called by <em>ayahuasca!</em> He followed
the call and later emerged from the forest with the a sampling of the fairly
rare liana that today is cultivated by the ayahuasquero in secret spots. I
myself certainly did not hear the call. If this jungle life and its irrational
mutual dependency forms a picture of general confusion, ayahuasca is the
magic mirror that reflects this confusion as something beautiful and
attractive. For whomever I listened to, all manifested the enjoyment of a
wonderous spectacle that was pleasing to the senses. If fearsome visions
occurred they said that the ayahuasquero could easily dispell them by
shaking a dry twig near the ear of the affected drinker; or by blowing the
smoke of a cigarette on the crown of his head. The aesthetic climax of the
spectacle was, they claimed, the 'vision of the goddess with concealed eyes,'
who dwelt inside the twining tropical vine. Many times I listened to these
tales but it never crossed my mind to try the liana myself. It belonged
definitely to the local indian lore, to something sordid, outside of the law,
something publically frowned upon like the binding up of the heads that the
cha-ma (sp) practice on their babies; or like burying one twin alive as they
also do; or so many other equally fantastic or ghastly things.
<p>
In 1949 I had my headquarters in a white washed brick house in pu-cul-pa
overlooking a wide curve of the Ucayali. Pu-cul-pa at that time was a village
of about 200 homes, a Catholic church, an American Protestant mission, a
Masonic temple and two primitive hotels. The place had gained some importance
by being at the end of the only road precariously connecting Lima and the
Pacific with a navigable river of the Amazon system. It also had an airport
which could be used when the ground was dry. After the war and the falling
of prices for rubber, the importance of the read decreased and Pu-cul-pa fell
back into the stagnation of a Peruvian jungle settlement. At that time I
realized that my days in the jungle were coming to an end and in spite of
being somewhat skeptical about the possible effects of the drug, I decided
to try it.
<p>
I drank the bitter salty extract of the vine three times. It  seemed too much
trouble to look for a venerated great ayahuasquero like Juan in-uma (sp) who
lived up the river near masi-eh-sia (sp). There were a number of less widely
esteemed fellows in pu-cul-pa such as no-lore-bey (sp) who was recommended to
me as the most reliable of the witch doctors in the village. Hs hut was the
last upstream in the long row of buildings above the steep shore of pu-cul-pa.
It was there that I found myself sitting on an empty gasoline crate while other
people squatted on the floor. I drank the required dose, about a quart, and
nothing happened. The only noticible effect was an increased auditory
sensitivity which is the reason why the drug is usually consumed in secluded
places at night. A neighborhood rooster crowed recklessly which upset me
considerably for it seemed to happen <em>right inside my head.</em> The
people in the hut were disturbed also - they sighed and shifted their
positions uneasily. No-lore-bey blamed the ineffectiveness of the drug on
the fact that it had not been freshly prepared.
<p>
Another evening the guide who carried my blanket led me to a hut far outside
the limits of the village. The hut, a typical structure of a floor on stilts
without walls covered by a thached roof, belonged to sal-dani-ah (sp), a
mestizo I did not particularly like who had many patients in the village.
I lay down on the raised floor of beaten palm bark, overlooking the clearing,
and sal-dani-ah handed me a bottle of ayahuasca. I started to drink and heard
him singing behind a partition where he was tending his patients. I listened
carefully to the startling song that is always sung in ken-cha (sp), the
language of the highland indians which only old people in the Ucayali region
speak. The song starts with a shrill musical question and continues with a
series of answers intermixed with hissing sounds and syncopated with
gutteral noises produced with the tongue against the palate. I drank the
whole dose sal-dani-ah had prepared for me and felt slightly dizzy and
nauseated. After a while I climbed down from the raised floor using the
ladder, made as usual by hacking footholds into an upright log. The clearing
and surrounding jungle looked as though covered with white ashes in the
strong moonlight. From the hut behind me I heard sound of voices speaking
monotonously. I heard sal-dani-ah intermittently singing the song or
administering his cures. One of the procedures used to relieve a pain is
actually to suck the pain out of the hurting member. When this has been
often enough the pain is supposed to be located in the doctor's mouth and
removed from there by spitting. Again my stimulated hearing reported those
awful noises so intensely that at times they were hard to endure. The next
day sal-dani-ah attributed this failure to the fact that I has a slight cold.
I was more skeptical than ever. After all, if unlike those people, I was not
able to hear the call of the plant, or to walk noiselessly through the
jungle maybe I lacked also the required acuteness of senses to meet the
irridescent goddess.
<p>
I am glad that I went a third time. I made another appointment with
no-lore-bey for a saturday night. I walked out to his place at the edge of
the forest at about 10pm. I realized that his one room house that stood in
darkness and silence was crowded and waited outside till he emerged. I told
him that I would rather not join the crowd and he obligingly showed me a
good-sized canoe pulled up for repairs and resting about twenty feet from
the cane wall of his shack towards the edge of the jungle. I wrapped myself
in a blanket and lay down comfortably; my shoulders against the cedar walls
of the dugout - my head resting on the slanting stern. I felt relaxed and
full of expectation. No-lore-bey had appeared eager and confident. A small
barefooted indian with something queer and slightly funny about his face he
showed a nervousness that did not go with his sturdy build. He seemed to be
never quite present as if continuously distracted by frequent encounters
with his vegetable gods and devils. His eyes were not steady but pulled in
different directions. While something fearful, there was something very happy
about this man, as if a hidden gaity were buried under his worried features.
He believed himself smart and powerful. He lived a glorious life, even if
sometimes he seemed to go to pieces in his effort to walk back and forth
professionally between two equally puzzling worlds. I remembered seeing him
once in the como-sari-ah (sp) in conflict with one of them (one of those
equally puzzling worlds), accused again of leading a disorderly life and
practicing quackery. He was standing in his formerly green trousers before
a wooden table and the Peruvian flag answering the rude guardia-seville (sp)
with a humble smile - his eyes going apologetically in all directions.
<p>
He soon appeared with a gourd full of liquid he had carefully prepared by
stewing for hours the leaves of the vine with those of another plant who's
name possibly was his secret. He squatted at the canoe and whispered, his
eyes going sideways, 'Gringo, today you will experience the real thing.
I will serve you well. We will have the true intoxication. You will be
satisfied, wait and see..' and he left me alone. After a while a girl
approached me from the hut and asked for a cigarette. She lighted it,
inhaled, and for a moment I saw her wide face surrounded by hard black
hair, then she walked noiselessly back into the hut. A two-eye-oh (sp)
bird began to call repeatedly high above my face. The whistling and
melodious sound at the end of his call seemed to touch me like a whiplash.
A truck loaded with cedar boards left the village and on the distant
highyway accelerated madly and shifted gears. By that time I knew the drug
was working in me. I felt fine and heard no-lore-bey whispering near my
ear again, 'Do you want more? Shall I give you more? Do you want to see the
Goddess well?' And again I drank the full gourd of cool bitter liquid.
<p>
I cannot say how often no-lore-bey was present whispering and drinking with
me, singing the song near my ear and far away, treating his patients and
making those awful primitive noises that I despised. There was another
sound that upset me more than anything, like something round falling into
a deep well, a mysterious, slippery and indecent sound. Much later I found
out that it was produced by normally innocuous action of no-lore-bey
ladeling water out of an old oil barrel by means of a snall gourd.
<p>
I yawned through what seemed to be an interminable night till the muscles of
my face were strained. Sometimes I yawned so hard that it seemed to me as
loud as the roaring of the sea on a rocky coast. Things got so gay, absorbing
and beautiful that I had to laugh foolishly. The laughter came out of my
insides of its own accord and shook me absurdly. At the same time I cried,
and the tears that were running down my face were annoying, but they kept
running madly and no matter how often I wiped my cheeks I could not dry them.
<p>
The first visual experience was like fireworks. Then a continuously creating
power produced a wealth of simple and elaborate flat patterns and color.
There were patterns that consisted of twining repeats and others
geometrically organized with rectangles or squares that were like Maya
designs or those decorations which the cha-ma paint of their thin ringing
pottery. The visions were in constant flux. First intermittently, then
successively the flat patterns gave way to deep brown, purple or beige
depths like dimly lighted caves in which the walls were too far away to be
perceived. At times snake-like stems of plants were growing profusely in the
depths, at others these were covered with arrangements of myriads of lights
that, like dewdrops of gems, adorned them. Now and then brilliant light
illuminated the scene as though by photographic flash showing wide landscapes 
with trees placed at regular intervals or just empty plains. A big ship with
many flags appeared in one of these flashes. A merry-go-round with people
dressed in brightly colored garments in another. The song of no-lore-bey in
the backround seemed to physically touch a brain-center, and each of his
hissing, gutteral syncopations hurt and started new centers of hallucinations
which kept on moving and changing to the rhythm of his chant. At a certain
point I felt helplessly that no-lore-bey and his song could do ANYTHING with
me. There was one note in his song that came back again and again which made
me slide deeper whenever it appeared, deeper and deeper into a place where I
might lose consciousness. If, to reassure myself, I opened my eyes, I saw the
dark wall of the jungle covered with jewels - as if a net of lights had been
thrown over it. Upon closing my eyes again I could renew the procession of
slick, well-lighted images. There were two very definite attractions. I
enjoyed the unreality of a created world. The images casual, accidental or
imperfect but fully organized to the last detail of highly complex,
consistent, yet forever changing, designs. They were harmonized in color and
had a slick sensuous polished finish. The other attraction of which I was
very conscious at the time was inexplicable sensation of intimacy with the
visions. They were mine and concerned only me. I remembered an indian telling
me that whenevr he drank ayahuasca he had such beautiful visions that used to
put his hands over his eyes for fear someone might steal them. I felt the
same way. The color scheme became a harmony of browns and greens. Naked
dancers appeared turning slowly in spiral movements. Spots of brassy lights 
played on their bodies which gave them the texture of polished stone. Their
faces were inclined and hidden in deep shadows. Their coming into existence
in the center of the vision coincided with the rhythm of no-lore-bey's song
and they advanced forward and to the sides, turning slowly. I <em>longed</em>
to see their faces. At last the whole field of vision was taken up by a
single dancer with inclined face covered by a raised arm. As my desire to see
the face became <em>unendurable</em> it appeared suddenly in full close-up,
with closed eyes. I knew that when the extraordinary face opened those eyes
I experienced a satisfaction of a kind I had never known. It was the visual
solution of a personal riddle.
<p>
I got up and walked away without disturbing no-lore-bey. When I arrived home
I was still subject to uncontrollable fits of yawning and laughter. I sat
down before my house. I remembered that a drop of dew fell from the tin roof
and that its impact was so noisy that it made me shudder. I looked at my
watch and realized it was not yet midnight. The next day, and for quite some
time I felt <em>unusually</em> well. Three years later in a letter from
pu-cul-pa I heard that no-lore-bey had been accused of bewitching a man into
insanity and had been jailed in Iquitos.
